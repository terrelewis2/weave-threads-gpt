The apparent superior/inferior status of the messenger clouds their thinking.\n\nClear thinkers practice their best to evaluate the message separately from the messenger.\n4) Tough to communicate\n\nWhen dealing with close choices, most people pick the choice that is less stressful to communicate &amp; reject the choice that will seemingly require a tough conversation\n\nClear thinkers resist this bias &amp; communicate the correct choice as kindly as possible\n5) Probabilistic thinking\n\nMost people think in terms of “X will happen” “Y will not happen”.

Once you share this idea with… https://t.co/I6WwcwnSdr\nOne other important thing:\n\nNote that Apple Pie Positions are, by definition, specific to the context. This means that the same sentence can be either the right thing to focus on, or it can be an Apple Pie Position. The way you determine which is which is through good judgment.\nJust because someone says “What are the success criteria here?” or “What data do we have to back that up?” does not *automatically* make it an Apple Pie Position. But also remember that it isn’t *always* a good question and it might even majorly detract from our goals at times.\nNow, if you are going, “but what are the objective criteria for detecting [blah][blah][blah]”, I am sorry, but this won’t work for you and you should come back when you are ready. There is no tweet that will ever be a substitute for good judgment.

Nor to be the kind of person that needs any sort of entertainment as a prerequisite for learning.\n\n90% of smart people will never consider this conclusion.\nIf you can be a person who does not need to be entertained very much (or at all) to learn, you will learn more things &amp; different things than someone else who absolutely needs to be entertained for learning.\n\nThey will discard the profound book with a boring title, but you won’t.\nThis is not an isolated example. The Antithesis Principle is more widely applicable than might first be apparent. Let’s look at another example.\n2nd example.\n\nObservation:\n\nA charismatic person will almost always influence people a lot more than a similarly capable uncharismatic person will. \n\nA charismatic person will usually even influence people a lot more than a much more capable uncharismatic person will.\nWhat you should conclude from this\n\n1) To grow your influence as a leader, it is better for you learn the art of charisma (the obvious conclusion)\n\n2) To be wiser, it is in your best interest to work towards not being swayed by other people’s charisma (the non-obvious conclusion)\nNow, most smart people think that they don’t get swayed by charisma. But most of them are wrong. They do get swayed by charisma all the time. They just don’t like to think that (because accepting that would contradict their self-image of being a smart person).\n\nSmart ≠ Wise\n3rd example.\n\nI am sure you’ve heard at some point in your life that “Within the first 7 seconds of meeting you, people form a solid impression of who you are”. \n\nNow, who knows if it is actually true, but let’s assume for a moment that it is true.\nWhat you should conclude\n\n1) To be effective, you should consciously try to create a good 1st impression on other people (obvious)\n\n2) It is in your best interest to work towards not being a person who forms a fixed impression of someone based on the first 7 seconds (non-obvious)\n4th example\n\nEveryone talks about how a great manager is so important. Tweet out “Only work for great managers” &amp; you’re sure to get hundreds of likes &amp; retweets. But reality is different from Twitter.\n\nYes, a manager is important, but let’s apply the Antithesis principle here.\nTo make a big impact\n\n1) you should try to be a competent manager so you can help people do really good work (obvious conclusion)\n\n2) you should turn yourself into a person who does really good work even when you report to an OK/absentee manager yourself (not obvious conclusion)\nWhy can’t most people deal with the Antithesis Principle?\n\nTwo reasons:\n1) People love consistency. The Antithesis Principle creates inconsistency. Most people cannot process inconsistency.\n\n2) People don't question their default programming. And when other people are programmed similarly, that's great validation for them to stay with the defaults.\nSo, here’s the Antithesis Principle:\n\nYou might need to understand a certain thing about how the world works &amp; apply it, so you can be effective.\n\nBut you may need to adopt the antithesis of that to yourself so you can be a wiser, kinder, happier, more effective person yourself.\nArmed with this context, you will find the Antithesis Principle in all sorts of places.\n\nTake the idea that people love analogies. The Antithesis Principle says that you should explain by analogy (to help people understand) but not reason by analogy (to make yourself understand).\nIt applies to so many situations\n\nSo keep the Antithesis Principle in the back of your mind next time you make an observation about the world around you. You will not only reach the obvious conclusion that everyone reaches but also the non-obvious conclusion that very few reach.\nBack to the top of this thread:\nhttps://t.co/T39A1ioDJI\nBrilliant point.
