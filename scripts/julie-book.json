Are any of them designers? Hit them up. Even if they won't join you, ask for recruiting advice. Ask for referrals.\nSource designers with start-up backgrounds\n\n95% of designers don't want to be a first designer. They like having collaborators / mentors. So randomly msging big co designers yields little fruit. \n\nMake a list of past start-ups, identify the designer, and go from there.\nAsk designers you admire for coffee, even if you aren't able to recruit them. Learn what kind of environment they'd love to work at.

Sometimes you'll face headwinds and other times, tailwinds. What you goal your team's work on should be on top of that.\n7/8: Are our goal metrics sensitive enough to give us feedback on individual launches? \n\nA short feedback loop = more operational efficiency. While slow-moving, lagging metrics may be better long-term proxies for success, goal metrics should also help you make daily decisions.\n8/8 What % confidence do we have that we will hit our goals? \n\nGood metric goal targets should be realistic yet aspirational. Shoot for between 50-50 and 70-30.\nPicking the right goal metrics is as much art as science. \n\nYou want: \nAlignment with the mission\nOperational\nRealistic\nAspirational\n\nMake sure you understand your team's chosen goal metrics and targets.

This was also my first time working with a PM. \n\nShe asked me when my work would be done by. I had no experience with design scoping, so I said I'd get back to her.\nI brought the question to some senior designers on my team. \n\n\"How long should a project like this take?\"\n\nA shrug. Then: \"It'll take as long as it takes until it's good.\"\nSince then, as I've grown in my career, I've been asked this question hundreds of times.\n\nI usually give some variant of the same answer.\n\nThe PM or engineering manager will then look at me, baffled by my imprecisely disconcerting response.\nBut this is how creativity works. Jack Kerouac wrote On the Road in just three weeks. J.D. Salinger wrote The Catcher in the Rye in 10 years. \n\nThere is no recipe that guarantees something original and wonderful in a fixed amount of time.\nOf course, it's natural to crave certainty. We have fixed budgets. We must plan and coordinate with others.\n\nThe idea that something might take months or years to get right is scary.\nBut here's the yin-to-the-yang superpower that designers also typically have: deep trust in the process.\n\nCreative work should not be a 'wait and see' situation, like weather.\nIt should not feel like you're lost in a maze.\nIt should feel intentional, like mapping out new terrain.\nThe following steps never fail to calm me when a looming project seems overwhelming:\n\n1) Break the project up into smaller pieces, and just tackle the first step.\n\nFor example, if you're designing a new app from scratch, start with the default home screen, or the marketing page.\n2) Try N different takes on the idea.\n\nQuantity is king. Challenge yourself to do 5, 10, 20 versions. Resist the urge to censor yourself at this stage. \n\nJust get the ideas out.\n3) Show your work to a handful of others as soon as possible. Ask for their honest feedback.\n\nIt's great if these folks are designers; it's even better if they're actual customers.\n\nResist the urge to impress. The goal here is simply: get feedback that helps you improve the work.\n4) Iterate on your work based on the feedback. Repeat Step 3 again and again until you feel like your work is good.\n\n\"Good\" means you have confidence it solves the customer problem you set out to solve, and you feel proud of how it turned out.\nYou can't predict how many revs are needed.

But I am not picked.  How will I feel? There are 3 scenarios\n\n1) I'm disappointed but accepting of the decision\n2) I'm upset bc the decision-maker was unqualified\n3) I'm irate bc the criteria was wrong/unfair\n\"This is some political bullshit\" is often used to explain why we didn't get what we wanted when we are sure we are in the right, and we do not trust the decision-maker or the process.\nSadly, there are many instances when we *are* in the right, and picking us would have made the company better off. We *are* more qualified for the role. Our project *would* have made a  more meaningful difference than the alternative. Our cause *was* more critical to address.\nBut because of the decision-maker's poor judgment or biases (whether intentional or unintentional), the objectively best decision did not get made.\nA particularly irksome version of this is when we perceive someone to be pushing or deciding something because it's good for them personally, but is worse for the company. Like promoting a worse employee the boss is buddies with. Or funding a \"pet project\" that doesn't matter.\nBut too often (and I confess to having done this myself in the past), we may label something \"political\" simply because we disagree with the decision, even if the decision was made with great intentionality and care on the part of the decison-maker.\nSometimes, decisions are made against us that are not personal. As much as we don't like to admit it, maybe there's a good reason we weren't picked for the role. Or maybe that \"pet project\" we think is stupid is a reasonable bet to make if we had all the context.\nIf you find yourself frustrated with office politics, the following may help:\n\n1) Ensure that you know how your manager + their managers define success. Ask in 1:1s if this is not clear.\n\n2) Make sure your manager understands how *you* define success. \n\n3) ...\n3) Communicate your case clearly. Write an e-mail, prepare a deck‚Äîdo what works best for you. Always tie your case to what you understand success to be for your manager / their managers.\n\n4) Continually hone your communication skills. It is a key advantage. \n\n5) ...\n5) Ask for explanations to decision-making processes when they don't go the way you expect\n\n6) Ask yourself: did the decision-maker intend to do what they thought was best for the org? \n\n7) If 6 is yes, ask yourself: do I trust the decision-maker's abilities and their values?\nIf your answer to 6 or 7 is no, the environment probably feels toxic to you, and you should try to get out. \n\nOtherwise, make sure your perspective has been heard, and trust in the process. Don't take the decision personally. Disagreement isn't a bad thing; we all learn from it.\nIf you're a leader of a team frustrated w/ office politics, try the following:\n\n1) Walk the walk + talk the talk in putting the company's goals above your personal goals\n\n2) Create transparency around the process ahead of a decision. Eg what is the criteria for promotion? \n\n3)..\n3) Explain decisions thoroughly, especially the controversial ones.\n\n4) Build trust with your team. Care about them. Understand their personal goals. Show up like the imperfect human you are.

Here's a thread on what I learned üëá\nSome background first‚Äîin my own career, I came to the benefits of mentorship late. I really struggled with asking for help. I saw it as a weakness. \n\nThis is a fallacy many folks with imposter syndrome believe. We like the idea of \"mentorship\", but not \"exposing vulnerabilities.\"\nTo have a mentor truly help you, three things need to be true:\n\n1) You have to know when to ask for help and what specifically you need help with, \n2) You have to be willing to honestly share your dreams\n3) You have to be willing to honestly share your worries\nIt does not work for you to say \"Can you be my mentor?\" or \"I want my career to be X, can you help me?\" That is too vague. \n\nWhat's getting in your way? What specifically can I do for you? How do I know if I'm even the right person? \n\nIt can't be my job to discern what you need.\n(Btw: mentors don't need to be more senior than you. Clearly folks who have gone through your same experience in the past are helpful. But think of your peers. Can one of them give you useful advice on something you're struggling with? Depends on problem, but often YES!)\nSo my goal with this mentorship circle (which we called, very innovatively, D. Circle) was to make it a safe place to ask for help as well as discuss everyone's dreams and worries.\nMy assumptions were:\n\n1) Safety and trust takes time to develop, so let's make this 7 sessions and require full commitment in showing up.\n\n2) A loosely structured agenda, pre-reflection, and asking the right questions makes it easier to go deep into topics\n\n3) .... üëá\n3) It's hard to sustain a dream if it doesn't seem achievable, and something doesn't seem achievable if you don't know the path\n\n4) The more we know about someone's story, and the more their story resembles ours, the better we can help them\nI decided to create the group based on an application process that helped me understand 4) above. It was a pretty involved application, as you can see here: https://t.co/cIjC82ohCa\nExpecting maybe 20-50 applications, I put this out on Twitter and got over 350 from incredible designers all over the world. It was an extremely difficult task of selecting 8! Especially since so many shared with me their honest struggles.\nIn the end, I prioritized based on who I thought would benefit the most from the program. It's been a huge privilege to get to know and see the talents of @Noella_Dias, @LooooisYang, @susansoeun, @yinie0613, @e_see, @mala_panda, @mirdhaaakanksha and @TaylerAitken over the months!\nOne thing I loved was how we all co-created the curriculum together.
