        "thread": "Next time you think your product has a problem--stop.\n\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature.\n\nA simple framework for turning problems into solutions: üßµ\nMarketers are often put in a tight spot.\n\nHere‚Äôs a common situation:\n\nCEO: \"We have a product launch coming up. We need you to make people want this.‚Äù\n\nYou: ‚ÄúUmm I wish you had looped me in earlier. If it had x or y feature, it would be a lot easier to market.‚Äù\nBut it‚Äôs too late to change the product‚Ä¶\n\nSo what do you do?\n\nTurn bugs into features.\nIn engineering, a bug is an error or defect.\n\nThe inside joke is engineers will claim a bug is actually a feature. That‚Äôs often not true with software.\n\nBut in marketing, we actually CAN turn bugs into features.\n\nThe best marketers and brands do this regularly.\nThe things you thought were errors, constraints, or liabilities can actually become selling points.\n\nFor example, I used to think being an introvert was a bug.\n\nI wished I were more extroverted like other leaders and founders.\nBy thinking introversion was a bug, I kept beating myself up &amp; lamenting my circumstances.\n\nBut when I challenged myself to turn a bug into a feature‚Ä¶\n\nI realized being introverted contributed to my success‚Äìit allowed me to bring a different POV in a world full of extroverts.\nThe goal is to see your product‚Äìor yourself‚Äìwith fresh eyes.\n\nFeatures that you thought were initially bad might end up being what you emphasize.\n\nThose features might be perfect for a specific customer or scenario.\nInstead of rushing to change your product, you save time by working with what you already have.\n\nYou increase perceived value by owning the narrative.\n\nHere are three examples:\nAvis: Turning #2 into the winner\n\nIn the 1960s, Avis was the #2 car rental brand (behind Hertz at #1).\n\nBack then, it was blasphemy to market anything but being #1 in your category. https://t.co/mw0EXnw7r4\nBut Avis turned the fact that they were #2 from a bug into a feature. \n\nThey messaged that #1 brands don‚Äôt try as hard.\n\nThey said that because Avis was #2, they‚Äôd go the extra mile for you.\n\nThis frame shift caught customers‚Äô attention and built trust in Avis.\nSimplehuman: Trash cans as status symbols\n\nIf you think your category is boring, try marketing trash cans.\n\nSimplehuman, a premium trash can company, turned a basic category into a design-driven, luxury experience.\n\nSome sell for over $150‚Äîand they have a cult following. https://t.co/hBXFIy7lF3\nUgly fruit: Defects into selling points\n\nOne-fifth of all fruit and vegetables are thrown out because of small imperfections.\n\nThis causes a lot of waste.\n\nSo a French supermarket turned a bug into a feature. https://t.co/agMLwPNTxZ\nThey marketed ugly fruit as quirky, irreverent, interesting.\n\nThis gave customers a story to tell when their friends came over &amp; saw a weird apple or funky looking banana.\n\nThey repositioned a bug as a feature.\n\nThe ugly fruit was a hit and sold out faster than normal fruit.\nSo how do you turn a bug into a feature? Own the narrative.\n\nIf you're going to do something anyway, frame it as an intentional choice.\n\nThere are many opportunities to turn bugs into features in daily work &amp; life:\nBug üö´: \"This product is too basic. It doesn't offer enough features.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"We do one thing‚Äìand one thing only: Help you get X done.‚Äù\nBug üö´: \"This sucks because there are major quality control issues...\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"These ceramics are hand-made, so each piece is unique and will have minor differences.\"\nBug üö´: \"I don't want to do X. I don't enjoy it.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"I could do X. At the same time, that's not highly leveraged and you mentioned wanting me to focus on Y. With Y, I recommend doing...\"\nBug üö´: \"Ugh. Writing a 10 page proposal is a lot of work.‚Äù\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"I wouldn‚Äôt want you to have to read a 10 page proposal. How about I create a 1-page summary and we can go from there?‚Äù\nWhen you feel frustrated by the product you have to market, think about how you can turn a bug into a feature.\n\nIs your product ‚Äútoo simple‚Äù compared to competitors?\n\nMaybe simplicity is exactly the value proposition that a specific customer archetype is looking for.\nOr vice versa.\n\nIf your product is ‚Äútoo complicated‚Äù compared to your competitors, maybe there are customers who want a comprehensive, heavy-duty product.\nTo apply this framework, ask yourself:\n\n1. What do you think you have to hide?\n\n2. Is it something you can emphasize instead?\n\nWhen you have a constraint, don‚Äôt automatically look to downplay it.\n\nLean into it. Turn a bug into a feature.\nIf you enjoyed this, I write threads dissecting entrepreneurship, education, and marketing every week.\n\nFollow me @wes_kao to catch them in your feed.\nPS This lesson is part of our free program on building a successful cohort-based course.

        "thread": "Most people think building a course is all about marketing.\n\nAnd they're right.\n\nLuckily when I say \"marketing,\" I don‚Äôt mean hawking your wares. I mean adding value to people who would be glad to know you exist.\n\nHere are 7 ways to market your course (without being salesy):\n1. Sharpen your positioning\n\nPick a topic you‚Äôre credible in, where there's market demand, and you can talk about it for hours w/o preparation.\n\n‚Ä¢ What questions do you get asked all the time?\n‚Ä¢ What would you be invited to guest lecture on?\n‚Ä¢ What do you love talking about? https://t.co/3C6Ak1Aw0V\n2. Share your spiky point of view\n\nYour spiky point of view is a perspective other experts can disagree with. It's rooted in evidence &amp; not just a hot take.\n\n‚Ä¢ What do you wish more people understood?\n‚Ä¢ What's a best practice you think is overrated?\n\nhttps://t.co/dCPuFNSCv0\n3. Talk intelligently about your target students' problems\n\nWhen you speak with specificity and insight about the problem, a magical thing happens: \n\nPeople assume you know how to solve that problem.\n\nhttps://t.co/GHjaL9BJtH\n4. Get on the phone with prospective students\n\nTalking to your prospective students serves as market research &amp; an opportunity to build trust. \n\nPlus, this converts insanely well:\n\nMaven instructors reported 70%+ conversion from waitlist to enrolled after 1:1 calls.\n5. Share your best ideas freely\n\nYou might be wondering, ‚ÄúWes, why would I give free advice? Won‚Äôt that devalue my work?‚Äù\n\nNope.\n\nThe more you share, the more your prospective students will think, ‚ÄúIf their free stuff is this good, their paid stuff must be killer.‚Äù\n6. Turn your curriculum into marketing content\n\nWhen I review an instructor's course landing page, I often find amazing copy hidden in the syllabus.\n\nYou can easily turn each module into a meaty social post or newsletter issue.\n7. Tell success stories\n\nMany experts find it hard to talk about themselves.\n\nIf that's you, try talking about your clients, mentees, or former students:\n\n‚Ä¢ What problem did they deal with?\n‚Ä¢ Where are they now?\n‚Ä¢ How did you help them transform?\nMarketing is not about posting randomly on social 3x per week and hoping students will convert. \n\nIt's about consistently adding value to a specific group of people because you‚Äôre uniquely suited to help solve their problems.\nAsk yourself, ‚ÄúWhat can I share to add value to my audience?‚Äù\n\nThat should be at the core of your marketing.\n\nWhen you do this, you‚Äôll be surprised how your ideal students will gravitate towards you.\nPS This lesson is part of the @MavenHQ Course Accelerator‚Äîour free 3-week program on building a successful cohort-based course.

I worked at Y companies.‚Äù\n\nInstead, write your bio like it's sales copy. \n\nHere‚Äôs how:\nYou might think credibility is about working at fancy brands.\n\nThat might get your audience to perk up initially‚Ä¶\n\nBut it‚Äôs not enough to get them to buy.\nIf you haven't worked at fancy brands, you‚Äôre in luck.\n\nLots of folks with incredible bios worked at places you‚Äôve never heard of.

I've trained hundreds of PMs to build lightweight MVPs...\"\nWhy this works:\n\nThe ‚Äúbefore‚Äù just shows you were somewhere for a number of years.\n\nThe ‚Äúafter‚Äù shares a specific problem. When you elaborate on that problem, you show that you understand your target student‚Äôs situation.\n\nThis makes your solution (i.e. your course) more enticing.\nAnother example:\n\nüö´ Before: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve led UX design at X companies for 7 yrs.‚Äù\n\n‚úÖ After: ‚ÄúThe #1 reason UX designers don‚Äôt get a seat at the table is because they are seen as decorators, not leaders. I‚Äôve taught hundreds of designers to go from tactical to strategic.‚Äù\nWhy this works:\n\nThousands of designers have worked for 7+ years. It‚Äôs not interesting or helpful to lead with this.\n\nInstead, start with a spiky point of view that shares insight.\nAs a next step, audit your bio.\n\nIf you remove your work history, client list, and pedigree, do you still sound like an expert?\nPS If you‚Äôre an expert, operator, or consultant who‚Äôs ready to turn your knowledge into a course, @MavenHQ is the best way to get started.

I‚Äôve had the same resolution for a few years.\n\nHere are 5 habits that helped me worry less (that might help you, too):\nA few years ago, I was struck with a realization. \n\nIn the middle of my usual cycle of worrying, a little voice inside said, \n\n\"This thing you're worried about doesn't deserve to take up space in your head.\"\nBecause I started worrying less, I was able to:\n\n+ Have more energy\n+ Solve problems faster with more ease\n+ Improve relationships because I didn‚Äôt let things fester\n\nI want to share what I do to worry less because it could help you too.\n1. When I start to worry, I remind myself to stop\n\nThis is not an exciting answer, but it's practical and honest.\n\nThere isn‚Äôt one solution that simply removed my worries.\n\nI have to remind myself daily--and it's gotten easier over time.\n2. Walking phone calls\n\nI get antsy sitting all day.\n\nWalking allows me to get outside, get fresh air, and get exercise while on phone calls. \n\nI can work for much longer while feeling energized and more balanced.\n3. No notifications\n\nI don't have notifications for anything‚Äîtexts, emails, Slack messages, etc.\n\nYou're not going to forget to check Slack. \n\nYou probably check Slack obsessively, so without notifications, you will just check a little less obsessively.\n4. No-meeting days\n\nI'm shocked at how many people start important work at 6pm when their meetings end.\n\nI get so much done on no-meeting Wednesdays at Maven. It's sacred time for deep work. \n\nOn other days, I reserve 12-6pm for meetings with breaks to check Slack and execute.\n5. Decide if you're going to take action\n\nIf I'm not going to take action, then the worry stays in my head.\n\nI ask myself ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to do anything about this right now, why think about it more? You can worry about this later.‚Äù\nThere's a difference btwn worrying vs figuring out how to solve a tricky problem.\n\nIf the latter, try articulating the issue to a partner/friend who's agreed to listen.\n\nVerbalizing your worry can help you realize it's not so bad. You may even talk your way into a solution.\nPS Speaking of new year intentions... \n\nIf your 2023 goal is to build another income stream or invest in your personal brand, consider building a course.\n\n@MavenHQ instructors earn $20k in their first cohort on average.

You can‚Äôt find a mentor.\n\nThis is the most obvious reason. You might be reaching out to potential mentors but not hearing back.\n\nThis is normal‚Äìpeople have a lot going on. They might be getting tons of requests like this.\n\nIt's frustrating but isn't a reflection of your worth.\n2. It's too hard to explain context.\n \nYou might need to move fast and make a decision. It takes too long to explain all the backstory, characters, dynamics, etc.\n\nOr the nature of your work is confidential. Without the full picture, others can't give you accurate feedback.\n3. The question is relatively minor.\n\nIf you only talk to your mentor once in a while, you want to save the time to talk about important topics.\n\nBut you might encounter dozens of small issues on a daily basis where a gut check is helpful.\n\nIt just doesn't meet the bar to ask.\nSo how do you mentor yourself?\n\nChannel your heroes. These voices are already in your head:\n\n‚Ä¢ Authors\n‚Ä¢ Past coaches/mentors\n‚Ä¢ Managers\n‚Ä¢ Peers\n‚Ä¢ Friends you respect\nAsk yourself:\n\n\"If I explained my situation to x, what would they say? What would they tell me to consider?\"\n\nIt might sound strange to talk to yourself. \n\nBut you‚Äôre in your own head already‚Äîyou might as well learn to have better conversations with yourself.\nTo be clear, having sounding boards is fantastic. You should definitely try to get one.\n \nAt the same time, asking others for gut checks can become a crutch.\n\nIt's easy to think \"I should just ask them real quick right?\" for every little thing instead of thinking for yourself.\nA good way to counteract this is to think,\n \n\"If I were truly on my own, what would I do?\"\n \nThe holy grail is when you say to yourself what they would have said to you.\n \nTrick your brain and see what ideas you come up with.\nChances are, you'll pick the best option, execute, and realize it wasn‚Äôt so bad.\n \nYou won‚Äôt improve on every issue by mentoring yourself.\n \nBut if you try, you‚Äôll get further than you think.\nIn most difficult professional situations, no one is coming to save you. \n\nLearning to be your own mentor is how you survive and thrive.\nWhile you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶ \n\nTo grow faster in your career, check out a live &amp; community-driven course on Maven.\n\nClasses are starting soon on people management, leadership, business strategy, and more: https://t.co/8qSCZJs6qt",

It‚Äôs working on problems that stretch you. It's embracing challenges that feel scary in the moment, but afterwards, you're happy you did it.\n\nBad struggle is overanalyzing, fighting yourself &amp; slogging on projects with little upside\nEx: I know a creator who gets very anxious when public speaking.\n\nHe says no to all public speaking, period. Why? He doesn‚Äôt want to get good at it. For him, it's bad struggle.\n\nHe makes a living writing his newsletter &amp; has plenty of chances to stretch himself in other ways.\nüö´ Myth: Learn learn learn learn learn\n \n‚úÖ Truth: Learn do learn do learn do\n\nI call this the Learn Do Cycle: the fastest most visceral way to learn is to alternate quickly between learning and doing. It‚Äôs a never-ending virtuous cycle.\n\nStop being a spectator &amp; get in the arena\nLearning is doing. Doing is learning. They bleed together--they are one in the same.\n\nYou can read a dozen books on how to sell but you‚Äôll learn more by trying to get a prospect to say yes.\n\nThe best part: When you try selling THEN read more on sales, those tips will hit harder\nüö´ Myth: Use sheer willpower at all costs.\n \n‚úÖ Truth: Brute force can only get you so far.\n\nIn the past, my default solution was to work harder.\n\nNow I see brute force as a short term solution. You can only eke out so much productivity per hour before the gains are incremental\nProductivity tips are helpful‚Ä¶ But there‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôve already maximized this.\n\nThe next unlock in leverage might be to change your strategy.\n\nThis could mean cutting an entire category of tasks, building a new system, or changing the types of decisions you‚Äôre involved in.\nüö´ Myth: Data matters.\n \n‚úÖ Truth: Instinct matters too.\n \nInstinct is millions of subconscious data points accrued over time, reps, and experience.\n \nTry to go deeper &amp; explain why your instincts are telling you x.

It's just a gut feeling.‚Äù\n\nThe hiring committee can‚Äôt do much with that info.\n\nInstead, try to articulate specific examples, clues, and data points that led to your hunch.\nExample: \"I got this hunch because first, the candidate asked multiple times when they could expect to get more headcount. Second, their energy level went up the most when talking about coaching direct reports. Third, they couldn't explain their playbook beyond a surface level.\"\nüö´ Myth: I can do work that‚Äôs fast or high quality but not both.\n\n‚úÖ Truth: I can aim for fast and high quality.\n\nI love Stripe‚Äôs company value of ‚Äúfast-paced, detail-oriented.‚Äù \n\nThey refuse lazy trade-offs.

        "thread": "I find inspiration rarely comes from obsessing about the competition.\n\nHere are 7 powerful places to look instead:\nIf you‚Äôre building something new, you can‚Äôt only look at what‚Äôs immediately around you.\n\nYour own industry might give you some ideas, but staying too narrow can lead to incremental improvements.\n \nTo challenge your assumptions, look to new sources of inspiration.\nIn 2014, I learned this firsthand when building the altMBA with bestselling author Seth Godin.\n\nWe intentionally avoided looking at online education players in the market.\n\nInstead we studied organizations that made people feel zealous &amp; focused on principles rooted in psychology\nThe benefit?\n\nWe had many analogies to draw on when making decisions.\n\nAnd\n\nWe didn‚Äôt copy any one source. We took a bunch of ideas--then remixed &amp; added our own experience, instincts, and strengths.\n\nHere are 7 unexpected places we looked for inspo &amp; how it shaped our thinking:\n1. Military\n\n‚Ä¢ Identifiable signals: haircut, uniforms, lingo\n‚Ä¢ Strict process, no exceptions\n‚Ä¢ Basic training is grueling on purpose\n \nThe struggle leads to transformation.\n\nTakeaway: Inspired the altMBA challenge coin, grueling projects, and mandatory schedule.\n2. CrossFit\n\nIt's the opposite of Fight Club: The first rule of CrossFit is to always talk about CrossFit.\n\nIf you have friends who do CrossFit, you know what I mean.\n\n‚ÄúPeople like us work out until we puke. We don‚Äôt need fancy gyms.‚Äù\n\nTakeaway: Inspired ideas for word of mouth.\n3. Religion\n \n‚Ä¢ Dress codes\n‚Ä¢ Can‚Äôt eat certain foods\n‚Ä¢ Religious holidays\n‚Ä¢ Church on Sundays\n \nThese are ways to bring up your religion with outsiders.\n \nExample: someone at a party might say ‚Äúdo you have kosher options?‚Äù\n \nTakeaway: Gave ideas around insiders vs outsiders\n4. Startup Weekend\n\nA 54-hour weekend event where groups form teams with strangers &amp; develop a working prototype.\n\nTakeaway: Inspired intense deadlines of shipping projects within a day with your altMBA learning pod.\n5. Dance-a-thons\n\nThese were popular in the US in the 1920s.\n\n As concentrated endurance contests, they gathered the community for an intense sprint. \n\nSome ran for 100+ hours straight!\n\nTakeaway: Inspired the altMBA workshop structure of intense sprinting.\n6. Fraternities\n\n‚Ä¢ Shared struggle leads to bonding, cohesion, solidarity\n‚Ä¢ Cognitive dissonance (‚Äúif I sacrificed I must want this‚Äù)\n‚Ä¢ Status of pledges vs actives\n\nTakeaway: Inspired design of the altMBA so students would feel closest w/ learning pods from their first week\n7. Alcoholics Anonymous\n\nStanford research showed AA members develop close bonds with each other. \n\nMeetings aren‚Äôt led by professionals so it fosters a sense of trust between members.\n\nTakeaway: Inspired peer-led groups in the altMBA.\nTo build something new, find different sources of inspiration.\n\nWhile you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶\n\nInnovation is a big part of your work as a founder--as is figuring out what customers want and driving growth. \n\nTo level up, check out these three new @MavenHQ courses:\nUser Research Bootcamp: \n\nMaster UX research fundamentals with Heatherlee Nguyen.

Your first set of customers might not be your forever customers.\n\nWe got started with a certain profile of instructor: creators with big audiences.\n\nIt was win-win because we taught them how to build courses, so it was ‚Äúfound money‚Äù for them &amp; a way for us to enter the market.\nBut over time, we were surprised to find our hypothesis was wrong.\n\nThere was no correlation between folks w/big audiences &amp; how successful their courses were.\n\nIn fact, many of our most successful instructors had small audiences but were credible experts and willing to hustle.\n2. Smaller team of the right people is better than bigger team of the wrong people.\n\nSome team members ended up not being a fit. I was scared to lose headcount but learned a team can operate FASTER with fewer hands on deck.\n\nI knew this intellectually but finally saw it firsthand\n3. There‚Äôs good struggle vs bad struggle.\n\nGood struggle is thrashing to shape an idea. It‚Äôs developing conviction. It‚Äôs answering hard questions about what to do. You can‚Äôt outsource this.\n\nBad struggle is pontificating, overanalyzing &amp; optimizing past diminishing returns.\n4. Brute force usually isn‚Äôt the answer.\n\nIn past companies my default solution was: work longer hours.\n\nI still work pretty long hours but now I see brute force as a short term solution.\n\nIf you have to rely on brute force forever, you need to go back to the drawing board.\n5. Best way to learn is to do.\n \nThe fastest, most visceral way to internalize a lesson is to do. Stop being a spectator &amp; get in the arena.\n\nüö´ Old way: Learn learn learn learn learn\n\n‚úÖ New way: Learn do learn do learn do\n\nI‚Äôm bullish on CBCs bc it‚Äôs all about learning by doing\n6. Instincts matter.\n\nWe're not Amazon. We don't have millions of data points. \"A/B tests\" are directional at best.\n\nMost of a startup's first bets are driven by the founders' intuition on where to place bets.\n\nIdeally your instincts are right most of the time.\nIn some ways, instinct is millions of subconscious data points accrued over time, reps, and experience.\n\nThere's not enough data to \"prove\" that you should do x or y. It could go either way.\n\nAnd you can't and won't know if you're right until 3-6 months later.\n7. Look at primary data.\n\nTerrifying truth: Ten people can look at the same primary data &amp; come to opposite conclusions.\n\nNow if someone says \"x isn't interested\" or \"y isn't working,\" the first thing I say:\n\n\"Forward me the note or send screenshots.\" I want to look at it myself.\n8. Refuse lazy trade-offs.\n\nWe need to hold seemingly opposing ideas in our minds without imploding. You can:\n\n- Have a mission AND be relentless about revenue\n- Take frequent feedback AND execute quickly\n- Have a plan AND stay nimble\n9. Engineer room for serendipity.\n\nEarly on, we suggested first-time instructors to run 3 week courses.\n\nSome said ‚ÄúNope we‚Äôll try a 3 day course.\"\n\nWe said,\"Great! Let us know how it goes.\"\n\nIt was a huge hit. Now we recommend instructors do shorter (1 week) courses bc of this\n10. Shoulda woulda coulda.\n\nWe launched with a bang bc the co-founders had a great social presence (combined 250k on Twitter).\n\nBut the product wasn‚Äôt ready. Many instructors saw the jankiest version of our product--and it‚Äôs now significantly better, more beautiful, easier to use\nBut if we didn't launch with a bang... We wouldn‚Äôt have gotten all our initial customers and momentum.\n\nShould we have waited to launch until our product was more built out? We'll never know.\n\nThere are trade-offs with every path.\n11. Give the people what they want.\n \nStudents loved Maven courses. But they asked for a few things in particular:\n\nMore ways to interact with each other. More ways to discover courses.\n\nSo we listened to their feedback.\nThat's why this week, we're announcing an exciting launch:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚Äã‚ÄãAll new https://t.co/Ig9cgr7x0Z\n‚Ä¢ Fall Season w/ 100+ courses\n‚Ä¢ Faster, more intuitive student portal\n‚Ä¢ New community chat &amp; project features\n\nCheck it out and let me know what you think!\n\nhttps://t.co/zSMeFOTyeZ https://t.co/ZHYNh6JYYM",

I agree it is ‚Äúpossible‚Äù but I personally observe an epidemic of poor management (including micro-management). I‚Äôm always a big advocate of ‚Äútake responsibility‚Äù, but I think the idea that most micro-management is reactionary is off.\n@wes_kao What I run into over and over again in my industry are line leaders who want to do the right thing and are feeling disempowered (or lack the experience/tools to grow &amp; solve problems). Senior leaders have good intent as well, but also often aren‚Äôt equipped to lead well.\n@wes_kao And at the end of the day a general needs to be more responsible (and accountable) than a soldier. That‚Äôs a hill I‚Äôm willing to die on.\n@Lindorn From the outside looking in, the military seems to have less room for BS than most orgs.

It‚Äôll be okay.\n\nHere‚Äôs the framework I use to turn every feedback conversation into a win-win:\nFeedback conversations are typically reactive.\n\nYou‚Äôve been frustrated for a while, so you see the opportunity to share feedback as a chance to FINALLY unload.\n\nBut your recipient isn‚Äôt sure where all the negativity is coming from.\nThey‚Äôre hurt, confused, and defensive.\n\nInstead of embracing your feedback, they see it as an attack. \n\nYou worry about retaliation because now things are awkward. \n\nYou wonder if you should have stayed silent‚Ä¶\n\nHere‚Äôs a better way:\nI call this framework Strategy vs Self-Expression:\n\nüëç Strategy = Anything that contributes to potential behavior change \n\nüëé Self expression = Everything else you should not say\n\nFeedback conversations should be about strategy, not self-expression.\nEvery feedback conversation is actually a sales conversation.\n\nThe prize? Behavior change.\n\nSweet, sweet behavior change.\n\nYour feedback is a mechanism to change the person‚Äôs future actions. It‚Äôs the bridge from how they ARE behaving to how YOU WANT THEM to behave.\nSelf-expression is counterproductive.\n\nWhat it looks like:\n\n‚ùå Venting your frustration\n‚ùå Trying to teach someone a lesson\n‚ùå Trying to prove you're right\n\n90% of what you want to say off the top of your head is probably self-expression.\nSelf-expression is why most feedback conversations fail.\n\nAfter all, you‚Äôve been annoyed with this person for a while. You want them to know how they made your life harder.\n\nIt‚Äôs common to unload your pent up bitterness onto them. This has the opposite effect of what you want.\nOn the other hand, strategy is productive.\n \nIt means ONLY saying things that lead to positive behavior change.\n \nYour recipient will be:\n \n‚úÖ Eager to improve\n‚úÖ Motivated to change\n‚úÖ Excited to work with you\nWhenever I deviate from strategy, I instantly regret it.\n\nSo before you speak, ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs this strategy or self-expression?‚Äù\n\nHere are 3 steps to ensure you prioritize strategy:\n1. Mentally forgive the person\n\nThis part is important.

        "thread": "The key to standing out in a noisy world?\n\nYour spiky point of view.\n\nHow to instantly separate your ideas from everyone else's:\nWhat is a spiky point of view?\n\nIt‚Äôs a perspective others can disagree with.\n\nA belief you feel strongly about and are willing to advocate for.\n\nYour thesis about topics in your area of expertise.\nFor example, here‚Äôs one of my spiky POV:\n\nHigh performers don‚Äôt wait for their managers to tell them what to do.\n\nInstead, you should manage your manager.\n\nhttps://t.co/tZpCHHdn5T\nYour spiky points of view are what separate you from everyone else.\n\nSourced from your:\n‚Ä¢ Experience\n‚Ä¢ Personality\n‚Ä¢ Instincts\n‚Ä¢ Intuition\n‚Ä¢ Skills\n\nThe factors that have molded you into the person you are today.\nA spiky point of view is almost impossible to imitate.\n\nIt‚Äôs unique to each person--a powerful competitive advantage, rooted in your conviction and authenticity.\n\nThe best part?\n\nYou already have it in you.\n\nHere are the key elements of a spiky point of view:\n1. A spiky point of view must be debatable\n\nOther experts in your field should be able to disagree with your spiky point of view.\n \nOtherwise it‚Äôs too middle of the road.\n \nEx: Some marketers are pro market research. Others think surveys are mostly useless. Both camps are right.\n2. A spiky point of view isn‚Äôt controversial for the sake of it\n\nBeing contrarian for the sake of it is lazy and annoying.\n\nSome people say mic drop things to attract attention, but don‚Äôt have the expertise or logic to back up their statements.\n\nDon‚Äôt be that person. It's cringe.\n3. A spiky point of view shares a new insight\n\nRespect your audience‚Äôs intelligence.\n\nNo one wants regurgitated and obvious advice, so offer insights that show problems in a new light.\n\nYou want folks to say, \"Wow I never thought about it this way, this makes a lot of sense.‚Äù\n4. A spiky point of view doesn‚Äôt have to be a universal truth\n\nYour perspective should be defensible. It should withstand scrutiny.\n\nBut it doesn‚Äôt have to be THE one truth.\n\nThere can be multiple right answers, styles, approaches--and your spiky point of view is yours.\n5. A spiky point of view requires conviction\n\nYou should believe in your perspective strongly enough to advocate for it.\n\nYou'll need to put in the effort to persuade your audience.\n\nIt takes courage to share your perspective because some people will inevitably disagree with you.\nWhat a spiky POV isn‚Äôt: A random, emotion-fueled opinion.\n \nA hot take on politics is not a spiky POV... unless you're an expert in the area you're commenting on.\n \nMore importantly, you should know the argument well enough to advocate for the opposite view!\nTo bring this to life, here are a few of my spiky POVs:\n\nüåµ If you‚Äôre building an online course, you need to build marketing into your ‚Äúproduct‚Äù from day one.\n\nYou can‚Äôt afford to tack on marketing at the end because you‚Äôll build the wrong thing and no one will know it exists.\nüåµ Launches aren‚Äôt a one-time event.\n\nMost companies do a ton of work for the launch but don‚Äôt spend enough time on what happens after.\n\nA successful launch means sustaining the momentum once the confetti settles.\nüåµ When you teach online, many people assume they‚Äôre 100% an instructor.\n\nBut you‚Äôre actually 50% an instructor and 50% an entertainer.\n\nAttention spans are short and the responsibility is on the instructor (not the student) to help students care.\nMore examples? Here are spiky points of view from Maven instructors:\n\nFor example, @davidjbland teaches a course on how to de-risk your business idea in 10 days.\n\nIn his course, he dives deeper into the \"how\" with projects, feedback, and hands-on practice. https://t.co/04pdEvULer\nSo how do you create your own spiky points of view?\n \nLuckily, you already have them in you. \n\nIt‚Äôs part of how you operate and how you approach your craft.\n \nTo get you started...\n \nHere are easy fill-in-the-blank templates:\n‚ÄúStop doing X. Start doing Y.‚Äù\n \n^ This template works because you're saying to stop doing something that seems reasonable. Your reader wants to hear more.\n \nHere's an example:\nhttps://t.co/xh6RbJwjn0\n\"Most people think X. But actually Y.\"\n\n^ This template gives you a chance to show your counter-intuitive ideas. \n\nMake sure you're able to support your claim with a solid argument.\n\nAn example:\nhttps://t.co/YDlauqvJgS\n‚ÄúThe best way to [achieve goal] is to [do thing they usually avoid].‚Äù\n\n^ This template hooks your reader's curiosity &amp; gives you a chance to explain more.\n\nPS We share lots of easy step-by-step templates, guides, and worksheets like this in the free Maven Course Accelerator. https://t.co/eAbZZjjpHC\nTo recap:\n\nA spiky POV is a perspective you feel strongly about &amp; is rooted in your expertise, but others can disagree with it.\n\nIt captures attention bc it stands out in a sea of sameness.\n\nTry it.\n\nYou‚Äôll be surprised by how people appreciate your willingness to take a stand.\nThanks for reading!\n\n1.

        "thread": "There is one marketing strategy I recommend more than any other. And I personally use it every week.\n\nWhat is it? Turn bugs into features.\n\nAll the best marketers and salespeople do it. Here's how you can too:\nWhat does it mean to turn a bug into a feature?\n\nIn engineering, a bug is an error or defect. The joke is engineers will claim a bug is actually a feature.\n\nThat‚Äôs not always true w/software...\n\nBut in marketing, we actually can turn bugs into features via creative positioning.\nInstead of rushing to change your product or lamenting your circumstances, you work with what you already have.\n\nYou increase perceived value by owning the narrative.\n\nHere are a few examples:\nSimplehuman: Trash cans as status symbols\n\nIf you think your category is boring, try marketing trash cans.\n\nSimplehuman turned a utilitarian category into a design-driven, luxury experience.\n\nSome of their trash cans sell for over $150‚Äîand they have a cult following. https://t.co/QKfRPijRUP\nAvis: Turning #2 into the winner\n\nIn the 1960s, Hertz was the #1 rental company. Avis was the #2, which might as well have been the lowest ranking company.\n\nBack then, it was embarrassing to market anything except being #1 in your category.\nBut Avis said being ranked #2 was a feature, not a bug.\n\nThey messaged that #1 brands don‚Äôt try as hard. They rest on their laurels.\n\nBecause Avis was #2, they‚Äôd go the extra mile for you.\n\nThis frame shift caught customers‚Äô attention and built trust in Avis. https://t.co/Hf5qcAvMaC\nUgly fruit: Defects into selling points\n\nOne-fifth of all fruit and vegetables are thrown out because of small imperfections.\n\nThis causes a lot of waste.\n\nSo a French supermarket turned a bug into a feature. https://t.co/3QWnfBC7I6\nThey marketed ugly fruit as quirky, irreverent, and bold.\n\nThis gave customers a story to tell when their friends came over &amp; saw a weird potato or funky looking banana.\n\nThey repositioned a bug as a feature.\n\nThe ugly fruit was a hit and sold out faster than normal fruit.\nThose were examples of how brands have turned bugs into features.\n\nBut how does this work for smaller organizations or individuals?\n\nThere are lots of opportunities to turn bugs into features in your daily work:\nBug üö´: \"Hey boss, I don't want to do X. I don't enjoy it.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"I could do X. But it's not as highly leveraged &amp; you mentioned wanting me to focus on Y. With Y, I could work on...\"\n\nExplain if your recommendation is a better way to drive the business--only if it‚Äôs true!\nBug üö´: \"Ugh. Writing a 10 page proposal is a lot of work.‚Äù\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"I wouldn‚Äôt want you to have to read a 10 page proposal. How about I create a 1-page summary and we can go from there?‚Äù\n\nFrame in terms of why it's better for the other person.\n\nhttps://t.co/eGhE18BYYT\nBug üö´: \"Your startup is too basic. Your product doesn't offer enough features.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"We do one thing‚Äìand one thing only: Help you get X done.‚Äù\n\nIs your product ‚Äútoo simple‚Äù?\n\nSimplicity might be exactly the value proposition a certain type of customer is looking for.\nBug üö´: \"This is too complicated.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"You get creative flexibility that goes beyond one-size-fits-all templates.‚Äù\n\nIf your product is ‚Äútoo complicated,‚Äù some customers want a comprehensive, heavy-duty product.\nBug üö´: \"This sucks because there are major quality control issues...\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"These ceramics are hand-made, so each piece is unique and will have minor differences.\"\n\nTurning bugs into features helps customers see ‚Äúimperfections‚Äù in a positive light.\nTo turn a bug into a feature, ask yourself:\n\n1. What are you feeling sheepish about?\n\n2. Is it something you can emphasize?\n\n3. How could it be a selling point if you owned the framing?\n\nWhen you have a constraint, don‚Äôt automatically downplay it. Turn a bug into a feature.\nThanks for reading!\n\n1.

Trust me, I‚Äôve tried.\n\n90% of the time, you need other people‚Äôs support and cooperation.\n\nAt a minimum, you don‚Äôt want them to be a blocker.\n\nYou need their buy-in.\nWhen people say yes, it means:\n\n‚úÖ More momentum and faith in your project\n‚úÖ More energy to do work that matters\n‚úÖ Less time worrying and trying to convince skeptics\nA few situations where you‚Äôd want an enthusiastic yes:\n\n‚Ä¢ Getting a warm introduction\n‚Ä¢ Pitching your idea\n‚Ä¢ Applying for a job\n‚Ä¢ Closing the sale\n\nNotice these are all examples where the other person COULD say yes‚Ä¶\n\nOr they could ignore you (a tactful way to say no).\nWarm introductions: \"I'd love to meet your friend from x company. Could you connect me with them?\"\n\nMarketing your event: \"Do you mind sharing this on social?\"\nGiving feedback: \"There were lots of errors in the recent doc.

Their pitch was entirely about themselves! https://t.co/AeRZTclvLZ\nYou might say, \"But Wes, if I'm writing a cold email or sharing on my idea, doesn't it have to be about me?\"\n\nYes and no.\n\nYou should frame your idea IN RELATION TO the other person. No one cares about your career goals, project, etc. They care about how it relates to them.\nBottom line: If you can't think of why it would be rational for them to give you an enthusiastic yes, go back to the drawing board.\n\nBe glad you caught yourself before hitting send. Luckily you still have time to improve how to frame your idea so they‚Äôll be eager to move forward.\nRight now, you probably have a situation where you are hoping for a yes. \nYou‚Äôre going to have to ask for it.

        "thread": "I used to feel insecure about my creative process.\n\nThen I heard a story about Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen‚Äîand I instantly felt better.\n\nHere‚Äôs the story: https://t.co/CP21unenqU\nIn 1983, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen met in Paris to discuss music.\n\nThey both went on to sell millions of records.\n\nTheir conversation perfectly captures two ends of a spectrum: the spectrum of how creators produce work.\nAdam Cohen (Leonard‚Äôs son) recalls the conversation his father told him. \n\nThis is a reenactment of how I imagine the conversation went:\nBob Dylan and Leonard Cohen are sitting in a cafe in Paris, the morning after a Dylan concert that Cohen attended.\n\nLeonard Cohen: ‚ÄúGreat show yesterday, Bob.‚Äù\n\nBob Dylan: ‚ÄúThank you! Btw I loved your song 'Hallelujah.'‚Äù\n\nLeonard Cohen: ‚ÄúThanks man.‚Äù\nBob Dylan: ‚ÄúHow long did it take you to write?‚Äù\n\nLeonard Cohen: ‚ÄúHmm about 2 years. I loved your song ‚ÄòI and I.' How long did it take to write?‚Äù\n\nBob Dylan: ‚Äú15 minutes.‚Äù\n\nLeonard Cohen: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Nice.‚Äù\n\nActually Leonard Cohen lied.\n\nIt took him FIVE YEARS to write ‚ÄòHallelujah.‚Äô üò¨\nThis is one of my favorite stories. \n\nFor me, this speaks to two styles of experts:\n\n(A) the ‚Äújust ship it‚Äù expert (Bob Dylan)\n\n(B) the ‚Äúmeticulous at their craft‚Äù expert (Leonard Cohen)\n\nHere‚Äôs what I mean:\nBob Dylan‚Äôs achievements:\n\n‚Ä¢ 600 published songs\n‚Ä¢ 10 Grammys\n‚Ä¢ 2 Album of the Year awards\n‚Ä¢ 1 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nHe was prolific to say the least. He shipped often.\nOn the other hand, Leonard Cohen was meticulous. You might even say an overthinker.\n\nBut he was still the GOAT:\n\n‚Ä¢ In Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame\n‚Ä¢ ‚ÄòHallelujah‚Äô covered by 300+ artists\n‚Ä¢ Prolific poet &amp; novelist\n‚Ä¢ Won 4 Grammys\n\nDespite taking 5 years to write a single song.\nI‚Äôm in the Cohen camp. I‚Äôm an overthinker.\n\nWhat made it worse:\n\nWhen I started writing, I compared myself to others.\n\nMost folks seemed like Bob Dylans.\n\n‚Ä¢ They published quickly\n‚Ä¢ Didn‚Äôt worry much\n‚Ä¢ Wrote a lot\n\nIn comparison, my process was slow &amp; full of self-loathing.\nI was embarrassed to share how much work went into what I did.\n\nFor years, I tried solving this personality trait.\n\nOne day, I realized it's a constraint. It's part of how I work.\n\nI‚Äôll never be someone who has an idea &amp; publishes an article the next day.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs okay.\nI realized I could turn a bug into a feature.\n \n‚Ä¢ Embrace my instincts\n‚Ä¢ Choose a publishing cadence that works for me\n‚Ä¢ Acknowledge upsides/downsides to every style\n \nI could aim for high quality... AND learn to be mindful of diminishing returns.\nWhen Leonard was asked how he felt that Bob Dylan only took 15 minutes to write a hit song, Leonard said:\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the way the cards are dealt.‚Äù\n\nI appreciate the honesty of his response.\n\nAnd I appreciate that he didn‚Äôt let his ‚Äúslow‚Äù process stop him from sharing his gift.\nIf you're the type of person who feels self-conscious about sharing...\n\nYou're probably exactly the type of person who should share more.\n \nI hope this story (and knowing Leonard was a fellow overthinker) is the nudge you need to consider sharing your expertise with the world.\nThat‚Äôs all for today.\n\nIf you found this valuable:\n\n1.

And people are more afraid of public speaking than death.\n\nBut public speaking is not as important as it seems.\nFor most folks, public speaking is low frequency.\n\nThink about the # of times you‚Äôve given a speech to a crowd.\n\nI‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not often.\n\nNow compare that to the # of interactions you have with co-workers every day, week, month, and year.\n\nThere are THOUSANDS of interactions\nMost folks mistakenly view these daily interactions as\n \n‚Ä¢ ‚Äújust‚Äù a meeting\n‚Ä¢ ‚Äújust‚Äù a call\n‚Ä¢ ‚Äújust‚Äù a Slack message\n \nIn reality, each of these is an opportunity.\n \nYou‚Äôll be judged on the quality of your thinking whether you realize it or not.\nThere‚Äôs less room for BS in daily conversations.\n\nIt‚Äôs easy for anyone to be their best self on stage for a 30 minute speech.\n\nBut you can‚Äôt BS your way every day for months (or years) on a team of high performers.\n\nThere‚Äôs no room to hide.\nImagine two coworkers.\n\nCoworker A speaks:\n\nYou: ‚ÄúI have no idea what that person said. They said words but those words made no sense.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî&gt; üö´ You think less of this coworker.\nCoworker B speaks:\n\nYou: ‚ÄúWow that was an insightful point.

You believe they are thoughtful, competent, and rigorous.\nYour team doesn‚Äôt care how you are on your best day.\n\nThey will judge you for who you are on your AVERAGE day.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you give a jaw-dropping speech but can‚Äôt deliver consistently, day in and day out.\n\nBe consistently great‚Äìnot unpredictably, sporadically great.\nNow, let's talk tactics for how to shine in daily interactions at work:\nSpeak up more in meetings.\n\nThis one is tough for folks who are more introverted.\n\nIn meetings with 10-20 people, it can be hard to get a word in.\n\nBy the time you figure out what to say‚Ä¶ the conversation has moved on.\n\nBut if you stay quiet, nobody knows what or how you think.\nAn easy way to start speaking up in meetings:\n\nUse Zoom chat.\n\nIf you feel weird about interrupting, type your comment into the chat box.\n\nIt feels less scary. And you‚Äôre still getting your ideas out. Win-win.\n\nHalf the time, folks will read your comment &amp; ask you to jump in.\nAnother way to practice speaking up:\n\nGet an accountability buddy.\n\nAsk your coworker or manager to private DM you if you haven‚Äôt spoken &amp; they believe you‚Äôd have insight to offer to the conversation.\n\nIt‚Äôs them nudging you to say ‚ÄúSo, what do you think?‚Äù\n\nHelp them help you.\nAvoid what I call \"backstory scope creep.\"\n\nYou wouldn't ramble in a speech because it's not a good use of time.

        "thread": "Most online courses suck.\n\nHere‚Äôs why cohort-based courses are the future of learning:\nMost online education ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù hasn‚Äôt created a better experience for students or instructors.\n\nCohort-based courses are changing the game because they are:\n\n‚úÖ  Better for learners\n‚úÖ  Better for instructors\n\nLet‚Äôs cover why:\n1. Access to expertise\n\nYou won‚Äôt find instructors for cutting-edge topics like crypto or UX teaching full-time at a university.\n\nThe digitally-native professors of the future are often operators themselves &amp; draw from experience in the trenches.\n\nStudents are the beneficiaries.\n2. Bi-directional, not one-directional\n\nStudents learn from the instructor‚Äìbut can learn even more from fellow students.\n\nCohort-based courses allow for:\n‚Ä¢ Exposure to new people\n‚Ä¢ Opportunity to challenge your POV\n‚Ä¢ Chance to think for yourself\n\nIt‚Äôs a dynamic way to learn.\n3. Learning by doing\n\nIn working with thousands of students in cohort-based courses (CBCs), I've rarely heard students say \"I wish there were more lectures.\"\n\nWhat do they say?\nI wish there were more...\n\n‚àô small group discussions\n‚àô hands on projects\n‚àô critique/feedback\n‚àô Q&amp;A\n‚àô role playing\n‚àô time to hear from other students\n‚àô solo exercises\n‚àô reflection questions\n\nCBCs create space for this type of active learning.\n4. Higher completion rates\n\nCommunity, active learning, time constraints, and hands-on participation create best in class engagement and completion rates relative to passive online education.\n\nüö´  Static video courses have 3-6% completion rate\n\n‚úÖ  CBCs have 75% completion rate\n5. Sense of urgency\n\nIf something is available anytime, there's no reason to do it now.\n\nIn theory, watching videos on-demand gives you flexibility‚Ä¶\n\nIn reality, you get distracted halfway through the first video &amp; forget to come back.\nOn the other hand, a cohort-based course might only last 1-2 weeks.\n\nPersonally my best work has always been done in a sprint when there‚Äôs a deadline.\n\nNot rushed, but time bound. This forces students to prioritize and focus.\n6. Rigorous\n\nIn cohort-based courses, there‚Äôs no room for bullshit--and this includes from instructors.\n\nThere‚Äôs nowhere to hide. You‚Äôre forced to show up and do the work.\n\nThis makes the content more actionable and the outcomes more tangible. https://t.co/ITAotosQwi\n7. Accountability\n\n‚àô Non-trivial price points mean students have skin in the game\n\n‚àô Clear start and end dates create urgency to participate\n\n‚àô Positive peer pressure to show up for fellow classmates\n\nCBCs don't only rely on students‚Äô internal motivation.\n8. Community\n\nIt‚Äôs weird to admit but I‚Äôve been more vulnerable in small group discussions in CBCs than I have IRL‚Ä¶\n\nThe deep connections you make in CBCs are special.\n\nThey're lasting friendships that continue long after a course ends.\n\nhttps://t.co/xLeUCgace6\n9. Better for learning higher order skills\n\nMy friend Maya is a self-taught designer. She learned Photoshop via Skillshare courses.\n\nBut she said, ‚ÄúThese courses didn‚Äôt teach me about creative strategy, how to elevate my taste level, or make creative decisions.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs hard to learn higher order skills (like analyzing, reasoning, applying ideas) by reading a textbook or watching videos.\n\nYou need a collaborative space with critique, discussion, and hands-on practice.\n\nYou need other people. CBCs bring those people together.\n10. Instructors can monetize expertise\n\nYou still have to market your course, like you would for any product.\n\nBut you can build a thriving course business even if you don‚Äôt have millions of fans.\n\nAt Maven, instructors regularly earn $10-20K &amp; sometimes $100K+ in a single cohort\n11. Leverage\n\nYou need to create new content for newsletters, podcasts, tweets, etc on a weekly basis.\n\nBut you don‚Äôt need to create content from scratch each time you run your course.\n\nThe effort is front-loaded:\n\n¬∑ 80% to build the course upfront\n¬∑ 20% to run future cohorts\nWhen Seth Godin and I started the altMBA in 2015, I had no idea challenging the dominant form of online learning (video-based courses) would lead to a new course format.\n\nWe accidentally created a new category: cohort-based courses!\n\nAmazing to see all the activity in this space.\nAt @MavenHQ, we‚Äôll continue making it easier for experts to teach what they love.\n\nIf you found this valuable:\n\n1.

        "thread": "Most companies suck at on-boarding new team members.\n\nHere's how to on-board yourself when starting a new job:\nMany companies don‚Äôt have a formal on-boarding process.\n\nIt‚Äôs rare to get 3-4 weeks to just absorb and meet cross-functional team members.\n\nYou might have time for that at a bigger company‚Äì‚Äìbut at a growing company or smaller organization, there‚Äôs no such luxury.\nIf you wait to have information handed to you on a silver platter, it won‚Äôt happen.\n\nThe reason you were brought on in the first place is because the team was stretched for bandwidth.\n\nThey probably couldn‚Äôt wait any longer to bring someone on, which is why they hired you.\nSo how do you set yourself up for success?\n\nYou need to take charge of your own on-boarding process.\n\nHere are 6 principles for a successful self on-board:\n1. Take charge of the process.\n\nNo one is as invested in your success as you are.\n\nEveryone else is busy with their existing job! So embrace that you‚Äôll need to take the reins.\n\nThis is an opportunity to show you are proactive and self-directed‚Äîsomething every boss appreciates.\nAsk and answer some key questions:\n\nWhat information do you need to start contributing?\n\nWhat do you need access to?\n\nWhat hypotheses are you starting to develop?\n\nWhat‚Äôs an easy win in the first month?\n\nWhat key open questions do you have?\n2. Start developing a point of view.\n\nWrite down:\n\n¬∑ What you agree/disagree with\n¬∑ Ideas that provoke a reaction\n¬∑ Questions &amp; hunches\n\nMost people ask questions.\n\nBut it's even more important to share hunches.\n\nEven if you're wrong, it opens up conversation &amp; learning moments\nYou might think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still absorbing, I shouldn‚Äôt speak up yet.\"\n\nBut your fresh perspective is one of the most valuable things you bring.\n\nDon‚Äôt shy away from sharing what you‚Äôre noticing.\n3. Review information with an active stance.\n\nYour new team might send you lots of docs, resources, and links.\n\nThe great thing about high-performing environments is regardless of who you are, the team expects you to drive projects forward with accountability.\nThere‚Äôs no time for meetings just for the sake of it.\n\nIf you‚Äôre setting a meeting, think about how to make the best use of the time.\n\nCome prepared with an idea of what you want to get out of the meeting.\n4. Gather what you need to suggest next steps.\n\nThere‚Äôs a difference between passive vs active observation.\n\nYou should take time to absorb because you're learning the business, context, etc as a new hire.\n\nBut assume you‚Äôll be asked to make recommendations in the near future too\nQuestions to ask yourself:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Biggest gaps at the moment and how you can fill them\n\n‚úîÔ∏è What you might want to start/stop/continue\n\n‚úîÔ∏è How you want to lead and contribute\n\n‚úîÔ∏è The sequence of what you want to do\n\n‚úîÔ∏è What you want to prioritize given finite resources\nRemember:\n\nYou won‚Äôt answer these questions in the first week.\n\nIt‚Äôll take time. Be patient with yourself.\n\nThe goal is to start pondering these questions because it‚Äôll help you get grounded &amp; feel more confident.\n5. Assume you‚Äôll lead the meeting.\n\nYou behave differently when you‚Äôre a participant versus the meeting leader.\n\nIf you were driving the meeting, how would you operate?\n\nThis mindset puts you in an active stance.\n6. Identify the types of decisions you‚Äôll make.\n\nKnowing the type of decisions‚Äîand when you'll need to make them‚Äîhelps focus your efforts.\n\nAn upcoming decision implies not all info is equal.\n\nSeek info that‚Äôs relevant to you, so you can prioritize your on-boarding efforts.\nBy following these six principles, you'll be able to:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Show your value\n‚úîÔ∏è Start a new job with confidence\n‚úîÔ∏è Make an immediate impact\n\nOn-boarding doesn‚Äôt have to suck. Make it work to your advantage.\nBtw if you‚Äôre a hiring manager, you should still try to be thoughtful about on-boarding.\n\nJust because your new hire can drive their on-boarding, does NOT mean you are absolved of responsibility.\n\nBoth new hire AND manager should do their best to create a positive experience.\nThat‚Äôs it for today.\n\nIf you found this thread valuable:\n\n1.

        "thread": "I‚Äôve advised hundreds of course creators.\n\nAnd seen every mistake in the book.\n\nHere are 9 mistakes new course creators make (and how you can avoid them):\nMistake: Failing to think about course-market fit\n\nBefore you start to build, make sure:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è You‚Äôre the right person to teach this course\n‚úîÔ∏è People will pay to learn what you‚Äôre teaching (market demand)\n\nIf yes to both, you‚Äôre ready. If not, keep refining.\nMistake: Getting bogged down by analysis paralysis\n\nYour first cohort won‚Äôt be perfect.\n\nBut the best way to improve?\n\nShip it and iterate based on real student feedback.\n\nDon‚Äôt compare your first cohort to someone‚Äôs 50th cohort.\nMistake: One-directional lecture instead of bi-directional dialogue\n\nüö´  Students rarely say, ‚ÄúI wish we had more lecture.‚Äù\n\n‚úÖ  Lots of students say, ‚ÄúI wish we had more practice, discussion &amp; community.‚Äù\n\nAdd ‚Äústate changes‚Äù to drive engagement:\nhttps://t.co/XRTg3nW2YL\nMistake: Assuming you know it all\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Build alongside fellow creators\n‚úîÔ∏è Borrow from successful courses\n‚úîÔ∏è Learn from others‚Äô trial and error\n\nTo do exactly this, join the next Maven Course Accelerator: https://t.co/BhYeBR5IJt https://t.co/72Zbpq3oGm\nMistake: Misunderstanding the nature of leverage\n\nLaunching your first cohort is hard. You‚Äôll spend countless hours building.\n\nBut a course is a leveraged asset with high profit margins that you can ‚Äúturn on‚Äù whenever you want to run future cohorts.\n\nWork now, leverage later.\nMistake: Failing to harness the power of community\n\nAsync video courses have a 6% completion rate.\n\nCohort-based courses have a 70%+ completion rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause community is everything.\n\nIt keeps students engaged, lets instructors iterate quickly, and encourages friendships.\nMistake: Forgetting to make your students‚Äô eyes light up\n\nThe best course creators are 50% instructor and 50% entertainer.\n\nAll instructor? Students will be bored.\n\nAll entertainer? It‚Äôs a comedy show.\n\nPractice telling stories to engage your students.\n\nhttps://t.co/YrKC7MKFNJ\nMistake: People want to learn from experts, not explorers\n\nYou might be trying a new hobby or interest‚Ä¶\n\nBut it doesn‚Äôt mean you should teach a course on it.\n\nPick a course topic that‚Äôs overwhelmingly obvious. You should have clear expertise and a track record of success.\nMistake: Positioning as a vitamin instead of a painkiller\n\nVitamins are nice but painkillers are a need to have.\n\nStudents are willing to pay to solve painful problems.\n\nShow how much the problem is costing them, so they‚Äôll value the solution (ie your course).\n\nNo pain, no sale.\nThat‚Äôs it for today.\n\nIf you found this thread valuable:\n\n1.

        "thread": "Analytical skills didn‚Äôt come easily for me.\n\nIn college, my least favorite classes were quantitative... It was a miracle I even scraped by.\n\nLuckily, I found a way through.\n\n11 concepts to sharpen your analytical thinking:\nI used to look at numbers and feel helpless.\n\nWhich is why when I graduated, I was shocked that Gap HQ wanted to hire me as an analyst.\n\nThe job was 100% about numbers.\n\nI thought, ‚ÄúThey want me to manage millions of dollars and optimize profitability? With real money??‚Äù\nI couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúread‚Äù numbers and see a story--but over time, I learned.\n\nMy manager would send me a spreadsheet with endless rows of numbers in size 8 font, and I could make sense of it.\n\nIt was empowering.\n\nIf I can learn it, you can too.\nBeing analytical isn‚Äôt only about numbers.\n\nIt‚Äôs about:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Developing healthy skepticism and curiosity\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Validating your hypothesis (and having a hypothesis in the first place!)\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Vetting with multiple data points to get closer to the truth\nThe benefits of developing an analytical mindset:\n\n‚Ä¢ It gives you a competitive edge among your peers\n‚Ä¢ You'll make more informed decisions in work and life\n\nSo how can you sharpen your analytical thinking--even if you're not a \"numbers person\"?\n1. Patterns &amp; pattern breaks\n\nSee the norm, what sticks out, what needs a second look.\n\nThe idea is to get a lay of the land, so you can start developing a point of view.\nTo do that, you need to notice patterns.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù around here?\n‚Ä¢ What sticks out?\n‚Ä¢ Why is it sticking out?\n‚Ä¢ How much does it stick out compared to everything else?\n\nYou‚Äôll start to piece together the puzzle.\n2. Find the boundaries of an idea\n\nNotice when an idea applies to you and when it doesn‚Äôt.\n\nIt‚Äôs powerful to see nuances when other people just see a binary yes or no.\n\nYou want to be able to say:\n\n\"This works for x situations, but not for y situations.\"\n3. Absolute numbers &amp; percentages\n\nLook at both absolute numbers AND percentages.\n\nüö´  If you only look at absolute numbers?\n\nBig numbers seem good. Small numbers seem bad.\n\n‚úÖ  If you look at percentages too?\n \nYou‚Äôll see the relationship between the parts and the whole.\n4. Variance\n\nVariance is about change: change from the baseline &amp; changes over time.\n\nHow much did this change month over month?\n\nThis month vs this month last year?\n\nWas the variance in line with industry growth‚Äîor did it outpace or lag comparatively?\n5. Expected vs actual\n\n\"Wow, we drove 17% growth!\" might seem like good news‚Ä¶\n\nUnless you forecasted 30% growth. \n\nThis is where looking at expected vs actual numbers is useful:\n\nIf you compare the two, you can better understand how good performance really is.\n6. Percent contribution to whole\n\nYou can evaluate from the perspective of:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Money: ‚ÄúThis accounts for 80% of total $.\"\n‚úîÔ∏è Volume: ‚ÄúThis accounts for 27% of units.\"\n‚úîÔ∏è Top Hits: ‚ÄúThese 5 articles drove 80% of new visitors.\"\n\nYou can see relative importance.\n7. Zoom out to a broader scale\n\nIdentify peaks and valleys, i.e. the highest or lowest something has ever been.\n\nThis helps you see the range, which helps you get grounded. \n\nIf you have new assets or levers to pull, you can say, \"We'll beat the highest we've done because x.\"\n8. Check profit margins\n\nDon't get enamored by revenue alone. Look at margins as another data point.\n\nSomeone might say \"I made $5M in sales!\" but they spent $5M to do it.\n\nBut low margins aren‚Äôt necessarily bad. They might intentionally prioritize growth over profitability.\n9. Consider who benefits from a narrative\n\n‚Ä¢ What are the incentives of each party?\n\n‚Ä¢ If someone tells you x, how do they benefit?\n\nAnalyzing this allows you to understand where the other person is coming from.\n\nThen you can make a decision that's best for all parties.\n10. Poke holes in your own logic\n\nConsider why you might be wrong.\n\nThen look for data points so you either gain more conviction or adjust your thinking.\n\nIt can be helpful to state your assumptions. This lets folks point out if they're working off of different assumptions.\n11. Investigate why and what's next\n\nWhen you notice anything unexpected that catches your eye, ask yourself:\n\n‚Ä¢ Why is this happening?\n‚Ä¢ What's the impact?\n‚Ä¢ What should we do about it (if anything)?\n\nYou‚Äôre looking for clues to inform your assertions and recommendations.\nThat‚Äôs it for today.\n\nIf you found this thread valuable:\n\n1.

Remind them where you left off.\n\nTask switching takes a lot of energy.\n\nYour boss is probably reading your note in between meetings (or during one!).\n\nAssume they‚Äôre reading with partial attention. Remind them where you left off so they can task switch faster.\nüö´ ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the updated link.‚Äù\n\n‚úÖ ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the updated pitch.

        "thread": "You might read 52 books per year‚Ä¶\n\nBut I‚Äôm more impressed if you read one book and let it change you.\n\nHere are 9 tips to maximize your reading:\n1. Understand why you‚Äôre reading.\n\nMore books isn‚Äôt the goal.\n\nThe goal might be to:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è change your behavior\n‚úîÔ∏è sharpen your craft\n‚úîÔ∏è get into someone else‚Äôs head\n‚úîÔ∏è validate what you know but need a reminder of\n\nIf that means reading one or two books a year? Do that.\n2. You don‚Äôt have to read the whole book.\n\nIf the book doesn‚Äôt speak to you, find one that does. You don‚Äôt get points for suffering through a book you hate.\n\nOnce you embrace this, reading will instantly become more enjoyable.\n3. If you‚Äôre reading for entertainment, savor each page.\n\nI used to think everything was a race.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to force yourself to ‚Äúread faster‚Äù just to check a book off your list.\n\nTake your time and enjoy yourself.\n4. Stop when you ‚Äúget the joke.‚Äù\n\nFunny story from when I worked w/ Seth Godin:\n\nSeth: Here are 11 books for you to read.\n\nMe: Cool, I‚Äôll read one every few weeks?\n\nSeth: Finish them by end of day.\n\nHis point wasn‚Äôt to read cover to cover.\n\nIt was to read until you get the gist.\nStopping once you‚Äôve ‚Äúgotten the joke‚Äù is a useful tactic if you‚Äôre short on time &amp; have accomplished your goal with reading.\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to pressure yourself into reading every page if you‚Äôve already gotten value out of the material.\n\nGo out and apply what you learned.\n5. The library is your friend.\n\nLibraries make it easy for you to get a bunch of books and only read the ones you like--with 0 guilt about buying.\n\nI only buy books I‚Äôve already read and know are worth it.\n\nBorrow 95% of what you read from the library (&amp; donate $ when you can).\nMany libraries let you order books (or audiobooks) online. They‚Äôll send you an alert when your books are ready to pick up.\n\nIt‚Äôs pretty amazing. You can regularly get a dozen books at a time.\n6. You might be smarter than the author.\n\nThe bar for publishing is lower than it once was, so use your best judgment.\n\nLots of business books can be summed up in a 10-page blog post.\n\nRespect the author, but there‚Äôs no need to deify them.\n\nYour own ideas may be just as valid.\n7. Reread good books.\n\nYou‚Äôll experience them differently each time.\n\nWhy? The book stays the same, but you keep changing.\n\nI‚Äôve read my favorite sales books multiple times over the years.\n\nIt's the same principles, but I‚Äôm able to see them with more nuance each time.\n8. Read actively, not passively.\n\nPassive reading is flipping pages w/o thinking about what you‚Äôre consuming.\n\nActive reading is:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Connecting new and existing ideas\n‚úîÔ∏è Practicing skepticism\n‚úîÔ∏è Identifying how advice applies to your situation\n\nDon't go through the motions.\n9. Write notes in the margins.\n\nThis is the best way to do active reading. Engage with the material by writing notes and annotating the content.\n\nI circle sentences, make quick notes, jot questions.\n\nMark up your book--it‚Äôs a tool to inspire your thinking.\nBooks are mentors.\n\nThey‚Äôre more patient and accessible than humans too.\n\nI hope these approaches help you get a book‚Äôs full benefit, stop feeling guilty about being a slow reader, and savor the process more.\nThat's it for today.\n\nFollow me @wes_kao for more writing on startups, education, and marketing.\n\nI'll write a practical deep-dive on this in my newsletter.

You made it easy‚Ä¶\n\nBut customers STILL don't want what you‚Äôre selling.\nThe logic for reducing friction is:\n\n‚ÄúIf I make this easier (or cheaper) for you, you will eventually want it.‚Äù\n\nBut this is fundamentally flawed.\n\nHere‚Äôs a better way:\nI call this framework Increasing Desire vs Decreasing Friction:\n\nüëç Increasing desire = Getting your customers HUNGRY &amp; excited to buy\n\nüëé Decreasing friction = Reducing obstacles\n\nAverage marketers only focus on decreasing friction.\n\nThe best marketers focus on increasing desire\nLet‚Äôs take a step back.\n\nTo be clear, decreasing friction is good. You want to remove obstacles, like confusing UX or slow page load times.\n\nThe problem is 80% of founders/marketers ONLY reduce friction.\n\nThis leaves money on the table.\n\nWhy decreasing friction isn‚Äôt enough:\n1. Decreasing friction ignores that people jump through hoops for things they want.\n\nThey‚Äôre willing to go the extra mile‚Äîpay more, do more work, or try harder to get those things.\n\nYou could have fast page load times, but customers still might not care.\n2. Lots of products are free‚Äìand you still don‚Äôt want them.\n\nFor example, plenty of apps, tools, newsletters, etc cost nothing.\n\nBut you‚Äôre not itching to download or sign up.\n3. You‚Äôll hit a ceiling from reducing friction alone.\n\n‚ùå You‚Äôve made the button as big as it can be\n\n‚ùå You‚Äôve offered as many promotions as you can give\n\n‚ùå You‚Äôve sent lots of reminder emails\nIt‚Äôs a race to the bottom‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¢ You can only discount so much\n‚Ä¢ You can only send so many reminder emails\n\nThe problem is they DON‚ÄôT WANT what you‚Äôre selling.\n\nThey don't find it compelling or valuable, even if it's easy to buy.\nTo drive growth, you can‚Äôt just decrease friction.\n\nYou have to increase desire:\nWhat does it mean to increase desire?\n\nRemember: People jump through hoops for things *they want*.\n\nDid you pick your partner because they were the most convenient?\n\nNo, you chose them despite any obstacles:\n\nLocation, conflicts, in-laws‚Ä¶ üëÄ\n\nBecause you knew they were worth it\nThis is a line for Momofuku Milk Bar in Washington D.C.\n\nThese are the same people who say:\n\nüö´ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm swamped, can't hop on a call‚Äù\n\nüö´ ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have time for your product‚Äù\n\nBut they have time to wait for ice cream on a Tuesday afternoon!\n\nIncreasing desire &gt; Reducing friction https://t.co/rtMW82BPkx\nAnother example:\n\nHarvard makes you jump through hoops.\n\n‚Ä¢ Two letters of recommendation\n‚Ä¢ Multiple essays\n‚Ä¢ Hundreds of $ to take the SAT\n‚Ä¢ Thousands of $ in tuition\n\nThe dean doesn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs remove all requirements because it‚Äôs creating friction.‚Äù\nThey know their value &amp; they‚Äôre betting you will too.\n\nIf you get in, you‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúTake my money!‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing:\n\nCognitive dissonance is real.\n\nIt can work for you or against you.\n\nYour brain likes being consistent with itself.\n‚úÖ Here‚Äôs cognitive dissonance working in your favor:\n\nYour customer thinks,\n\n‚ÄúI waited in line for a long time to get this thing.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI would only do that for something I really want.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis thing is great.

        "thread": "Most people suck at giving feedback.\n\nHere‚Äôs a framework for feedback that creates behavior change:\nFeedback conversations are typically reactive.\n\nYou‚Äôve been frustrated for a while, so you see the opportunity to share feedback as a chance to FINALLY unload.\n\nBut your recipient isn‚Äôt sure where all the negativity is coming from.\nThey‚Äôre hurt, confused, and defensive.\n\nInstead of embracing your feedback, they see it as an attack.\n\nYou worry about retaliation because now things are awkward. \n\nYou wonder if you should have stayed silent‚Ä¶\n\nHere‚Äôs a better way:\nI call this framework Strategy vs Self-Expression:\n\nüëç Strategy = Anything that contributes to potential behavior change\n\nüëé Self expression = Everything else you should not say\n\nFeedback conversations should be about strategy, not self-expression.\nEvery feedback conversation is actually a sales conversation.\n\nThe prize? Behavior change.\n\nSweet, sweet behavior change.\n\nYour feedback is a mechanism to change the person‚Äôs future actions. It‚Äôs the bridge from how they ARE behaving to how YOU WANT THEM to behave.\nSelf-expression is counterproductive.\n\nWhat it looks like:\n\n‚ùå Venting and getting the last word\n‚ùå Trying to teach someone a lesson\n‚ùå Trying to prove you're right\n\n90% of what you want to say off the top of your head is probably self-expression.\nSelf-expression is why most feedback conversations fail.\n\nAfter all, you‚Äôve been annoyed with this person for a while. You want them to know how they made your life harder.\n\nIt‚Äôs common to unload your pent up frustration onto them. This has the opposite effect of what you want.\nOn the other hand, strategy is productive.\n\nIt means ONLY saying things that lead to positive behavior change.\n\nYour recipient will be:\n\n‚úÖ Eager to improve\n‚úÖ Motivated to change\n‚úÖ Excited to work with you\nWhenever I deviate from strategy, I instantly regret it.\n\nSo before you speak, ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs this strategy or self-expression?‚Äù\n\nHere are 3 steps to ensure you prioritize strategy:\n1. Mentally forgive the person\n\nThis part is important. Do not skip it.\n\nIf you are filled with resentment or anger, it WILL boil over.\n\nIt won‚Äôt take much to throw you off:\n\n‚Ä¢ A passive-aggressive comment\n‚Ä¢ A tiny smirk\n‚Ä¢ A raise of their eyebrows\nDon‚Äôt risk letting this derail you.\n\nGet your frustration out of your system BEFORE you walk into the room.\n\nTalk to your spouse, friend, or therapist.\n2. Identify what will motivate them to change\n\nThis isn‚Äôt about punishing them for the difficulty they caused you.\n\nYou‚Äôve already lived through it. The best thing you can do now is ensure they do better in the future.\nYour recipient can only do better if they:\n\n‚Ä¢ Know what to do\n‚Ä¢ Feel motivated\n‚Ä¢ Are excited and committed to change\n\nThis is why framing everything positively is important.\n\nThey must WANT to change.\nThis often means giving the benefit of the doubt even when‚Äìespecially when‚Äìyou don‚Äôt feel like the person deserves it.\n\nüö´ Before: ‚ÄúWhy did you do that? That was pretty bad. It embarrassed me and the whole company‚Ä¶ Your mistake caused x damage and y trouble.‚Äù\n‚úÖ After: ‚ÄúI totally get why you did that. You might have thought x or y. In the future, a better way to handle if something like this comes up is z. Here‚Äôs how to do it. I‚Äôm glad this happened though because it‚Äôs a great learning opportunity for all of us.‚Äù\nI will often intentionally minimize the recipient feeling bad.\n\nUsing phrases like ‚Äúit‚Äôs minor feedback‚Äù (even when it‚Äôs major) or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù are ways to do so.\n\nYou don‚Äôt want your recipient to panic or self-flagellate‚Äìit distracts them from improving.\n3. Say only the 10% that will actually change behavior\n\nBrainstorm and write out what you want to say‚Ä¶\n\nThen trim 90% of your original script!\n\nIf you‚Äôre honest with yourself, most of it was probably self-expression.\nOnly keep the parts that are specific and encouraging.\n\nNote: Being encouraging doesn‚Äôt mean empty nice words‚Ä¶ \n\nBeing encouraging means aligning incentives &amp; appealing to their self-interest.\nIn other words, you need to sell and persuade them to change:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è What‚Äôs the upside for them?\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Why will it benefit them to change?\n\n‚úîÔ∏è How will it get them closer to their goals?\n\nDon‚Äôt focus on why their behavior change helps you. Focus on why changing helps THEM.\nTo summarize, remember that feedback conversations are about strategy, not self-expression.\n\nThe goal is behavior change. Focus solely on getting closer to the behavior you want to see.\n\nGive this framework a shot and let me know what you think.\nThat‚Äôs it for today.\n\nIf you found this thread valuable:\n\n1.

Build trust among students quickly.\n\nCourses don‚Äôt last forever‚Äìthey have a start and end date.\n\nThis sense of urgency is exactly what most of us need to get our shit together and get focused.\n\nBut the time-bound element means you can't build community with a slow burn.\nLike a Michael Bay movie where cars blow up in the first three minutes, there needs to be action right away.\n\nFor a 2 week course, if students are feeling disengaged in the first week...\n\n50% of the course is already over.\n\nYikes üëÄ\nOn day one, course leaders should celebrate the behavior they want to see.\n\nGive public kudos to students who:\n\n‚úÖ Share their POV &amp; ask questions\n‚úÖ Engage with fellow students\n‚úÖ Take initiative to make things better\n\nTrust is an essential element of community.\n2. Culture develops quickly and is hard to change.\n\nThe first few days‚Äì*hours*--of a course are critical.\n\nEven BEFORE your course starts, your students have started to form an impression.\nThis sounds extreme but is normal.\n\nYou make snap judgments about the products and services you encounter every day...\n\nIt‚Äôs reasonable for your students to do the same.\nIf you let negativity go unchecked, it will fester.\n\nIf you let a disgruntled student whisper to others, the discontent grows.\n\nCommunity guidelines aren‚Äôt enough. You have to enforce &amp; celebrate the behavior actively.\n3. Communities reveal themselves over time, so there‚Äôs only so much you can do to prepare.\n\n‚úÖ Stay alert as culture takes shape\n‚úÖ Have a toolbox of tactics ready\n‚úÖ Stay flexible based on student reactions\n\nLike a subreddit, each course can have a different culture.\nAs a course community manager, you have to give students space to co-create with each other and with you.\n\nCreate an environment where serendipity and magic can happen.\n\nThen let the community reveal itself.\n\nYou won‚Äôt know what form it will take until students come together.\nDuring the course, you might say to yourself:\n\n\"Wow I‚Äôm surprised students liked this so much.‚Äù\n\nor\n\n\"Hmm I‚Äôm surprised students don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù\n\nBoth are equally useful insights that allow you to improve your course and community.\n4. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù from one course community to the other. \n\nThe tactics that work for writing students might not work for crypto students.\n\nCommunity tactics that work for one writing course might not work for other writing courses.\n5. Learning first, community second.\n\nCommunity without learning is hanging out with friends.\n\nBut course communities have to be about camaraderie AND enable learning at the same time.\nThis is an important distinction because it‚Äôs a higher bar to hit both of those criteria.\n\nReal learning often challenges us‚Äìand makes us feel a little insecure.\nThis can bring out the worst in students...\n\nüö´ Defensiveness\nüö´ Aggressive debating\nüö´ Demanding attitude with peers or the instructor\n\nBut when done well, cohort-based communities represent everything great about the Internet.\nLearning together can be a transformative experience that challenges you.\n\nYou‚Äôre sharpening your skills alongside peers to interact, analyze, and teach each other.\n\nIf you‚Äôre creating a course, it‚Äôs not enough to focus on the content‚Äìyou need just as much focus on the community.\nIf you enjoyed this, I write threads dissecting entrepreneurship, education, and marketing every week.\n\nFollow me @wes_kao to catch them in your feed.\nThinking about building a course?

You feel like you need to convince them or argue your point.\n\n‚úÖ After: Shorter, warmer response that gives the other person the benefit of the doubt. You come across as more confident.\n‚ùå Before: Assume the person will say no before you start.\n\n- You load up on caveats\n- Talk super fast to get everything out\n- Bring up counterpoints no one has mentioned yet\n\n‚úÖ After: Speak at a normal pace and show up prepared to make a strong case.\n‚ùå Before: Insist on email when you know a phone call is better.\n\nYou KNOW you should hop on a call to resolve the issue in 3 minutes.\n\nBut you‚Äôre nervous about messing up in real-time.\n\nInstead you spend 3 hours drafting the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù email.\n\n‚úÖ After: Just hop on a call.\nEqually important: Make sure your facial expressions and body language don‚Äôt look hesitant if you actually feel confident inside.\n\nIt sounds strange but‚Ä¶ control your face. :]\nWhat insecure vibes SOUNDS like:\n\nüö´ ‚ÄúHmm I‚Äôm sure this is not helpful but‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nüö´ ‚ÄúAnd this might not even be a good idea‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nüö´ ‚ÄúBut one thing is maybe try X?‚Äù\n\nüö´ ‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll say yes but‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nüö´ \"This is a lot of work so you probably won't want to do this...\"\nSo how do you get rid of insecure vibes?\n\nThe best thing you can do is get better at identifying when you might be giving them off. Learn to identify the markers and your tells.\n\nGive your friends permission to point it out.\n\nDo this with friends you trust.\nThis could be your spouse, close friend, or coworker.\n\nWhen you ask, ‚ÄúDo you mind taking a look at this?‚Äù\n\nAllow them to say, ‚ÄúOoh I think there might be some insecure vibes going on here...‚Äù\n\nThank them for their honesty, then edit your note accordingly.\nBefore you hit send, ask yourself:\n\n1. Could this be interpreted as sounding defensive?\n\n2. Does it look like I‚Äôm overcompensating?\n\n3. Am I feeling a little desperate?\nThink about you on your best day, feeling on top of your game.\n\nReact the way that person would react.\n\nIt‚Äôs the same you after all!\nBreak the cycle and level up your work, writing, and life.

        "thread": "Next time you think your product has a problem--stop.\n\nIt's not a bug, it's a feature.\n\nA simple framework for turning problems into solutions: üßµ\nMarketers are often put in a tight spot.\n\nHere‚Äôs a common situation:\n\nCEO: \"We have a product launch coming up. We need you to make people want this.‚Äù\n\nYou: ‚ÄúUmm I wish you had looped me in earlier. If it had x or y feature, it would be a lot easier to market.‚Äù\nBut it‚Äôs too late to change the product‚Ä¶\n\nSo what do you do?\n\nTurn bugs into features.\nIn engineering, a bug is an error or defect.\n\nThe inside joke is engineers will claim a bug is actually a feature. That‚Äôs often not true with software.\n\nBut in marketing, we actually CAN turn bugs into features.\n\nThe best marketers and brands do this regularly.\nThe things you thought were errors, constraints, or liabilities can actually become selling points.\n\nFor example, I used to think being an introvert was a bug.\n\nI wished I were more extroverted like other leaders and founders.\nBy thinking introversion was a bug, I kept beating myself up &amp; lamenting my circumstances.\n\nBut when I challenged myself to turn a bug into a feature‚Ä¶\n\nI realized being introverted contributed to my success‚Äìit allowed me to bring a different POV in a world full of extroverts.\nThe goal is to see your product‚Äìor yourself‚Äìwith fresh eyes.\n\nFeatures that you thought were initially bad might end up being what you emphasize.\n\nThose features might be perfect for a specific customer or scenario.\nInstead of rushing to change your product, you save time by working with what you already have.\n\nYou increase perceived value by owning the narrative.\n\nHere are three examples:\nAvis: Turning #2 into the winner\n\nIn the 1960s, Avis was the #2 car rental brand (behind Hertz at #1).\n\nBack then, it was blasphemy to market anything but being #1 in your category. https://t.co/r2O6K8IqSk\nBut Avis turned the fact that they were #2 from a bug into a feature. \n\nThey messaged that #1 brands don‚Äôt try as hard.\n\nThey said that because Avis was #2, they‚Äôd go the extra mile for you.\n\nThis frame shift caught customers‚Äô attention and built trust in Avis.\nSimplehuman: Trash cans as status symbols\n\nIf you think your category is boring, try marketing trash cans.\n\nSimplehuman, a premium trash can company, turned a basic category into a design-driven, luxury experience.\n\nSome sell for over $150‚Äîand they have a cult following. https://t.co/vS8LlNORbP\nUgly fruit: Defects into selling points\n\nOne-fifth of all fruit and vegetables are thrown out because of small imperfections.\n\nThis causes a lot of waste.\n\nSo a French supermarket turned a bug into a feature. https://t.co/pP1gUNJ28s\nThey marketed ugly fruit as quirky, irreverent, interesting.\n\nThis gave customers a story to tell when their friends came over &amp; saw a weird apple or funky looking banana.\n\nThey repositioned a bug as a feature.\n\nThe ugly fruit was a hit and sold out faster than normal fruit.\nSo how do you turn a bug into a feature? Own the narrative.\n\nIf you're going to do something anyway, frame it as an intentional choice.\n\nThere are many opportunities to turn bugs into features in daily work &amp; life:\nBug üö´: \"This product is too basic. It doesn't offer enough features.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"We do one thing‚Äìand one thing only: Help you get X done.‚Äù\nBug üö´: \"This sucks because there are major quality control issues...\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"These ceramics are hand-made, so each piece is unique and will have minor differences.\"\nBug üö´: \"I don't want to do X. I don't enjoy it.\"\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"I could do X. At the same time, that's not highly leveraged and you mentioned wanting me to focus on Y. With Y, I recommend doing...\"\nBug üö´: \"Ugh. Writing a 10 page proposal is a lot of work.‚Äù\n\nFeature ‚úÖ: \"I wouldn‚Äôt want you to have to read a 10 page proposal. How about I create a 1-page summary and we can go from there?‚Äù\nWhen you feel frustrated by the product you have to market, think about how you can turn a bug into a feature.\n\nIs your product ‚Äútoo simple‚Äù compared to competitors?\n\nMaybe simplicity is exactly the value proposition that a specific customer archetype is looking for.\nOr vice versa.\n\nIf your product is ‚Äútoo complicated‚Äù compared to your competitors, maybe there are customers who want a comprehensive, heavy-duty product.\nTo apply this framework, ask yourself:\n\n1. What do you think you have to hide?\n\n2. Is it something you can emphasize instead?\n\nWhen you have a constraint, don‚Äôt automatically look to downplay it.\n\nLean into it.

Movement forces audiences to become alert.\n\nThis is why it‚Äôs so excruciating to sit still &amp; be talked at on a Zoom call for an hour straight.\n\nIt‚Äôs mind-numbing.\nThe solution?\n\nAn approach I call the State Change Method:\n\nAim for a state change every 3‚Äì5 minutes to break up the monotony.\n\nA ‚Äústate change‚Äù is anything that punctuates an instructor‚Äôs monologue‚Äîit causes students to snap to attention. https://t.co/Mja6s1GHDv\nExamples of state changes include:\n\n‚Ä¢ Q&amp;A\n‚Ä¢ Breakout rooms\n‚Ä¢ Group discussions\n‚Ä¢ Asking students to comment\n‚Ä¢ Switching speakers\n‚Ä¢ Cracking a joke &amp; adding humor\n‚Ä¢ Switching from screen share to gallery view\nHere‚Äôs another way to think about it:\n\nWith 5 people, you can have a conversation. With 100, you can‚Äôt.\n\nSuddenly, you can‚Äôt read the room. You can‚Äôt easily tell what they‚Äôre thinking or use your charisma to fill gaps.\nThe dynamic has shifted‚Äìyou need to work harder to keep the audience engaged:\n\n1. Vary your pace/style: Fast and slow, loud and quiet.\n\nThe State Change Method creates a dynamic sense of rhythm.\n\nHumans appreciate rhythm and variety in everything. https://t.co/9vnthqSHhe\n2. Fight the urge to tell.\n\nEmbrace the Socratic method and ask instead.\n\nWhen a student approaches you with a question, throw it back at them.\n\nGive them a chance to think rigorously.\n\nInstead of answering right away, say:\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you think? How would you tackle this?‚Äù\n3. Add interactivity.\n\nWhen I ask students of CBCs what they want more of, they rarely say ‚Äúmore lectures.‚Äù\n\nInstead they say ‚ÄúI wish there were more chances to meet students, get feedback, and do role playing exercises.‚Äù\n\nWhen in doubt, add more interactivity. Not more content.\n4. Aim for a participatory experience in the first 5-10 mins.\n\nDon‚Äôt start off talking about your background for 20 mins (and immediately put everyone to sleep).\n\nSet the tone for participants that this is an active experience worth attending live. And worth staying awake for.\n5. Speed up the perceived pace of the live lecture. \n\nWith Zoom lectures, it‚Äôs better to have 5 slides with 1 point on each, than 1 slide with 5 points on it.\n\nOur eyes are used to seeing movement on screens. TV producers know this. Play into it.\nBefore-and-after: The State Change Method in practice.\n\nüö´ Before:\n\nYou: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why X is important. Reason 1, 2, 3.‚Äù\n\nStudents: Silence.

I've been on 30-minute calls where 25 minutes was backstory. üòÖ\n\nBe mindful of what I call backstory scope creep.\n\nIt‚Äôs a losing situation for everyone:\nAs the speaker, it means less time for you to receive advice/feedback. Also less time to talk about the topic you actually wanted to spend time on.\n\nAs the listener, you zone out and get lost in irrelevant details.\n\nSo how do you avoid this?\nBy aiming for the Minimum Viable Backstory.\n\nFirst, ask yourself:\n\nWhat‚Äôs the minimum backstory necessary to set the context, so we can spend time on the juicy stuff?\nYou‚Äôll have to fight your urge to over-explain.\n\nYou may think they need to know all the details upfront...\n\nThey don‚Äôt.\n\nYou‚Äôd be surprised how little backstory is needed to dive in.\n\nPlus you can always add relevant information later.\nThis applies to storytelling too.\n\nFor example, I can tell you about how I went camping:\n\nThree months ago, I started looking at national parks...\n\nI researched car rentals.\n\nPurchased outerwear.\n\nDrove 5 hours to the park.\n\nSet up our tent.\nFinally, 30 minutes into the story, I say:\n\n‚ÄúAnd on day five, Steve left beef jerky out in his tent.\n\nAnd the next thing we know, we‚Äôre almost getting mauled by a bear.‚Äù\n\nWHAT?? ü§Ø\nThe backstory crept in &amp; buried the lede.\n\nTo fix this: Start your story right before you get eaten by the bear.\n\nThis applies to Q&amp;A, pitches, team meetings, and sales conversations.\n\nPeople want to hear the juicy part. https://t.co/4ZnqtLl9WY\nHow does this apply to daily communication--like Slack?\n\nPut the key point at the top, then more context beneath.\n\nHere‚Äôs what it would look like:\n\n2-3 sentences with the main point of your message.\n\nContext:\n\n4-5 paragraphs to share your thought process, rationale, risks, etc. https://t.co/8oDE9bxXkF\nTo be clear, context is important.\n\nNon-essential backstory is different from useful context though.\n\nIf you have important context, include it.\n\nBut challenge yourself and ask whether the context is actually important--or if it‚Äôs a tangential side note and rabbit hole.\nTo deliver higher ROI communication, cut the backstory.\n\nAnd when you think there‚Äôs nothing left to cut... cut some more.\n\nIt will feel painful but you‚Äôll be surprised how much more efficient and impactful your words become.\nIf you enjoyed this, I write threads dissecting communication, entrepreneurship, education, and marketing every week.\n\nFollow me @wes_kao to catch them in your feed.\nI write deep dives on topics like this in my newsletter about 1x/month.\n\nSubscribe below to get new essays in your inbox\n\nhttps://t.co/dtM6vxGySC",

Trust me, I‚Äôve tried.\n\n90% of the time, you need other people‚Äôs support and cooperation.\n\nAt a minimum, you don‚Äôt want them to block you.\n\nYou need their buy-in.\nWhen people say yes, it means:\n\n‚úÖ More momentum and faith in your project\n‚úÖ More energy to do work that matters\n‚úÖ Less time worrying and trying to convince skeptics\nA few situations where you‚Äôd want an enthusiastic yes:\n\n‚Ä¢ Getting a warm introduction\n‚Ä¢ Pitching your idea\n‚Ä¢ Applying for a job\n‚Ä¢ Closing the sale\n\nNotice these are all examples where the other person COULD say yes‚Ä¶\n\nOr they could ignore you (a tactful way to say no).\nWarm introductions: \"I'd love to meet your friend from XYZ company.

The ideas are flimsy with logical gaps and obvious holes.\n\nAs a manager, you have two options to solve this problem:\n\nüö´ Make all the decisions for them.\n\n‚úÖ Empower them to think rigorously.\nLet‚Äôs talk about what I like to call rigorous thinking.\n\nRigorous thinking is asking critical questions about tactics and having a systematic way of making decisions.\n\nHere‚Äôs how it works in practice:\nAny idea goes.\n\nBut you have to be prepared to advocate for the idea and defend it.\n\nYou should be able to walk through the upside, downside, trade-offs, and second order effects.\n\nRigorous thinking is where flimsy ideas go to die.\nIt's the opposite of lazy thinking.\n\nLazy thinking is making assumptions you don't even realize are assumptions. Like assuming an idea will work w/o thinking about how to make it work.\n\nIt's a black box where \"suddenly we succeed and have thousands of sign ups.\"\n\nLet's compare:\nüö´ Lazy thinking: \"Hey boss, can we do [insert random tactic that competitors are doing]?\"\n\nüëé Result: Managers have to think through everything, which leads to decision fatigue.\nIn this world, you're always correcting your team‚Äôs mistakes and poor logic.\n\nYou have to think of polite ways to say \"this isn‚Äôt a good idea\" without discouraging your team.\n\nIf you always say no &amp; your team doesn‚Äôt understand why, you look like the bad guy.\n‚úÖ Rigorous thinking: \"Hey boss, I recommend we ___. It's worth the time, effort, and budget because ___. The downside is ___. But we can minimize risk with a small experiment by doing ___.‚Äù\n\nüëç Result: Managers have less decision fatigue. Direct reports are empowered.\nIn this world, you are working collaboratively to pressure test assumptions.\n\nYou rarely say no to an idea.\n\nIt's not about saying yes or no.\n\nIt's about vetting the idea.\nYou ask probing questions.\n\nYour direct report might realize their idea won't work in its current state.\n\nBut they're excited to go back to the drawing board, then show you their improved version.\n\nThey become sharper thinkers &amp; take ownership.\n\nYou get better results.\nA few questions you can ask to get started:\n\n‚ÄúWhat's the hard part?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat does success look like?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis is a great start. How do you see this working?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy would someone be excited to do the thing you want them to do?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWho do we need buy-in from for this to move forward?‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs not an interrogation.\n\nThe way you ask matters.\n\nDon‚Äôt sit back, kick your feet up, and wait to be impressed.\n\nThat wouldn‚Äôt bring out the best in you, and it won‚Äôt bring out the best in your team.\nAsk hard questions with a curious and supportive posture.\n\nWhen you take this approach as a manager, you empower your direct reports to figure out and articulate a solution.\n\nYou show that you're in the trenches with them and you believe in them.\nLet‚Äôs get tactical:\n\nThe next time a team member approaches you with a problem, gently toss it back at them.\n\nGive them a chance to practice thinking rigorously.\n\nInstead of answering their question, ask:\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you think? I want to hear how you would fill in the blanks.\"\nThey may struggle at first. You may wonder if it's worth it.\n\nBut if you consistently do this, your employees will become sharper and more independent.\n\nInvest the time to train your team--or burn a few hours every day to correct their work forever.\n\nThe choice is yours.\nTraining your team to think rigorously takes a load off your plate.\n\nIt‚Äôs an organizational force multiplier allowing everyone to produce higher quality work.\n\nI hope you‚Äôll give this a try.

How do these dates work?‚Äù\n\nThis implies to your boss that you need a break but in a more positive manner.\n#3 Keep your boss in the loop\n\nTactical tip: Agree to an update cadence for each project you‚Äôre working on--daily or weekly depending on the project‚Äôs scope.\n\nThis way they know you‚Äôre doing a great job AND they don‚Äôt need to micromanage.\nManaging up effectively has lots of benefits. Your boss:\n\nBelieves you‚Äôre capable\nBelieves you‚Äôre worth investing in\nBelieves you‚Äôre worth going to bat for\n\nThey‚Äôll take credit for managing you well. And that‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶\nIt‚Äôs actually good to let your boss take this credit.\n\nBecause they‚Äôll feel overwhelmingly positive, warm, and grateful for you.\n\nTranslation: Your boss will love you for managing up without knowing you are, in fact, managing them.\nImportant note: These ideas DO NOT apply to toxic bosses--those who throw you under the bus, gaslight you, and refuse to acknowledge your contributions. Sadly many of us have had to work under leaders like this &amp; the damage can take years to undo.\nWhen your boss loves you, you have options:\n\nTake on more interesting projects\nSpar 1:1 and riff on interesting ideas\nRoom to grow and develop skills in new areas\n\nIn short, you get the benefit of the doubt.\nYou have more control over your relationship with your boss than you think.\n\nAnd it all starts with embracing that it‚Äôs your responsibility to manage your boss.\nIf you enjoyed this thread, follow me @wes_kao for more tweets and threads on working effectively, the future of education, and building @MavenHQ.",

A spiky point of view can be debated.\n\nOthers should be able to disagree with your spiky point of view.\n\nIf everyone agrees with it, it‚Äôs too middle of the road.\n2. A spiky point of view isn‚Äôt controversial for the sake of it.\n\nThere‚Äôs nothing more irritating than a contrarian who just wants to stir the pot.\n\nThat's being intellectually lazy. \n\nDon‚Äôt be that person.\n3. A spiky point of view teaches your audience something relevant they don‚Äôt already know.\n\n‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt only ask questions\n‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt just summarize information\n\nOffer a point of view that makes people see their problem in a new way.\n4. A spiky point of view is rooted in evidence, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be a proven fact or universal truth.\n\nYour perspective should be defensible.\n\nYou should believe in it enough to advocate for it.\n\nBut you have to be okay with people disagreeing with you.\n5. A spiky point of view requires conviction.\n\nBe brave enough to advocate for what you believe in.\n\nIt‚Äôs not a passive regurgitation of information.\n\nYou‚Äôre trying to convince someone because you genuinely believe they‚Äôll be better for it.\nTo bring this to life, here are a few of my spiky POVs:\n\nIf you‚Äôre building an online course, you need to build marketing into your course from day one.\n\nYou can‚Äôt afford to tack on marketing at the end and hope for the best.\nLaunches aren‚Äôt a one-time event.\n\nMost companies do a ton of work for the launch but don‚Äôt spend enough time on what happens after.\n\n A successful launch means sustaining the momentum once the confetti settles.\nStop learning how to give feedback. \n\nFocus on learning to receive it.\n\nMost people are terrible at receiving feedback, so you only need to be a little better to win.\nWhen you teach online, many people assume they‚Äôre 100% an instructor.\n\nBut you‚Äôre actually 50% an instructor and 50% an entertainer.\n\nAttention spans are short and the responsibility is on the instructor (not the student) to help students understand why they should care.\nPrototyping is unnecessary in 90% of cases.\n\nIf you took 15 mins to think about a problem intently, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have to do a product sprint at all.\n\nInstead, use scenario planning and think through the logic of how your idea would work if you decided to launch today.\nIn summary:\n\nA spiky point of view shouldn't be a controversial hot take.\n\nIt's an opportunity to say the ideas you care about but are afraid people may push back on.\n\nTry it anyway.\n\nYou‚Äôll be surprised how people gravitate towards &amp; appreciate your willingness to take a stand.\nThanks for reading!\n\nIf you found this interesting, why not share?\n\n‚Ä¢ Retweet the 1st tweet &amp; help others find this thread.\n\n‚Ä¢ Follow me: @wes_kao\n\nI tweet spiky POVs about education, marketing &amp; community.",

        "thread": "We have a problem.\n\nThe world of online learning is stale.\n\nLack of community, low engagement, and no incentive for completion.\n\nTHREAD: Here's what‚Äôs next for the future of online education\nWe‚Äôre in a post-content age.\n\nIn the past, educational content was expensive and scarce. It became a major selling point for universities.\n\nToday, however, educational content is cheap and abundant. YouTube, newsletters, blogs, and social media all serve as modern universities.\nAnd it doesn't stop there...\n\nAccelerators, incubators, low-cost or free online courses, and alternative education programs have been created to serve the lifelong learning needs of working professionals.\n\nBut content abundance has created its own set of unique challenges:\nFirst, it‚Äôs become nearly impossible for instructors to make a living off their expertise.\n\nSocial platforms rarely support monetization activities. You post your expertise and have to pursue other ways to capitalize on it.\n\nCreators are effectively giving away valuable content.\nSecond, most learners are‚Äîcounterintuitively‚Äîactually worse off for all this cheap, abundant content.\n\nMore access does not equal more engagement.\n\nExample: MOOCs‚Äîthe massively open online courses that were popularized in the 2010s‚Äîhave completion rates of just 3 to 6 percent.\nSo we have a problem. How do we fix it?\n\nAt @MavenHQ, we believe cohort-based courses (\"CBCs\") hold the key.\n\nCBCs are interactive, community-centric online courses where a group of students advance through the material together‚Äîwith hands-on, feedback-based learning at the core.\nWhat makes CBCs unique?\n\nThey are engaging, real-time, and involve community-driven, active learning (as opposed to solo, passive content consumption).\n\nFixed start and end dates enforce the real-time aspect and create a scarcity within the abundance of content out there.\nScarcity drives value. In today‚Äôs content-rich world, what is scarce in online learning is community.\n\nCohort-based courses provide community (and so much more).\n\nWhether you're a potential instructor or student, come check out what we're building @MavenHQ.\n\nThe future is bright.\nAnd if you‚Äôre interested in teaching your own cohort-based course, apply to join our course accelerator:\n\nhttps://t.co/BhYeBR5IJt",

Consider partnering with complementary creators to enhance your reach.\n\n@aaditsh and @brandonthezhang are an example of partnering (for the launch of their CBC, \"Makers Mark\").\nhttps://t.co/MosgJbYPwZ\nOffer scholarships.\n\nWhen launching @alt_MBA with Seth Godin, I contacted companies where we wanted alumni for case studies.\n\nProviding scholarships to students from orgs like Nike &amp; Whole Foods enhanced our reputation &amp; attracted similar students going forward.\nMaven creator @iam_preethi recently partnered with @coinbase to offer 10 scholarships to her course. She‚Äôs giving back to the community &amp; driving word of mouth.\n\nCheck out Preethi's Ethereum Bootcamp launching later this month\nhttps://t.co/yw6NOlW81Z\nProvide testimonials.\n\nA large audience serves as social proof.\n\nBut if you don't have that, you can create social proof in other ways.\n\nTestimonials can help. Students trust testimonials more than traditional marketing methods.\nThese are 9 ways to launch a successful CBC w/o a large audience.

Except one is an investment &amp; the other is a never-ending slog\n@wes_kao Do you have any examples of how you all go about doing this? Is it culture, inter-personal, or more tactical like certain SOPs or structures?\n@lcrothlisberger @wes_kao +1 for some examples of training best practices, please @wes_kao\n@rdstevenson @lcrothlisberger @wes_kao Not Wes, but two things I've seen help:\n\n1. Onboarding that requires self-directed critical thought. As much guidance as advanced math textbooks.\n\n2. Culture of long-term thinking. This has to come from the top, but this is very teachable if the environment doesn't suffocate it.\n@MattMHarriman @rdstevenson @wes_kao Thanks for your input. Both are great points, #2 about a culture of long-term thinking really got me. Man, that is so true, but I have never thought of labeling it as such.\n@lcrothlisberger @rdstevenson @wes_kao Thanks.\n\nI was in an org where the only quarter that mattered was this one, and that made every quarter harder than the last...\n\nThe other bit is creating mentor-type relationships. Especially between mgr/employee, it helps the sr person get into teaching mode vs fixing mode.\n@MattMHarriman @lcrothlisberger @rdstevenson Great question on how to go about training your team to think more rigorously.\n\nHere‚Äôs a process and set of questions I use:\n\nhttps://t.co/kYtkw6zzDC\n@MattMHarriman @lcrothlisberger @rdstevenson This on-boarding approach is good for setting the expectation that team members should assume a proactive posture:\n\nhttps://t.co/PIO87cij2E\n@MattMHarriman @lcrothlisberger @rdstevenson This trains teams on how to give the right amount of context. And more importantly to be aware that giving context matters, so they can calibrate with their manager:\n\nhttps://t.co/QiC0HRHKKm\n@MattMHarriman @lcrothlisberger @rdstevenson This trains teams on critical thinking. Being analytical isn‚Äôt only abt numbers. It‚Äôs abt healthy skepticism/curiosity, validating hypotheses, looking for patterns &amp; pattern breaks. We‚Äôre not taught this in school but it‚Äôs so practical for every day life\n\nhttps://t.co/FhaoKoneH5",

        "thread": "I've had the same new year's intention for the past few years &amp; it's continued to improve my life. My new year's intention for 2021:\n\nWORRY LESS.\n\nThis is for all my over-thinkers, over-analyzers, and worriers out there. A few years ago I was struck with a realization üëá\nIn the middle of my usual cycle of worrying where I could barely hear my own thinking, a little voice inside said, \n\n\"You don't get paid enough to worry as much as you do.\"\n\nAt first, I felt shock. Then guilt. Then... liberation. Freedom. A swelling sense of moral authority.\nThere's no amount of money that is worth the emotional heaviness of worrying. Put the worry down. Set it over there in the corner.\n\nOf course, what I'm saying depends on your starting point. If you're too nonchalant, crank it up a notch and take more ownership.\nBut if you‚Äôre an overachiever who cares too much, making a conscious effort to worry less can improve your work and life.\n\n+ I was able to solve problems faster and more easily\n+ I had more energy bc I wasn‚Äôt running on a hamster wheel in my own head\n+ I had better relationships bc I didn‚Äôt let things fester in my mind\n\nHow do I measure that I actually worried less? I track the number of minutes I spend spinning my wheels with loud voices in my head.\nI catch myself when I start to feel a downward spiral gaining speed. I don‚Äôt actually count the minutes with a stopwatch, but when I start to worry, I mentally note the amount of time spent worrying. \n\nAny number of minutes is too long.\nTo stop myself in my tracks, I literally remind myself that I don‚Äôt get paid enough to spike my cortisol levels (stress hormone). I read that cortisol beyond small doses is pretty bad for your cells.\n\n‚ÄúIs this worth damaging my body long term? NOPE.\"\nIt's easy to get carried away if you love your work and care a lot. This is why you have to actively remind yourself to worry less. \n\nIn 2021, when I catch myself worrying, I‚Äôm going to gently remind myself to pause &amp; choose to do the work without the worry.\nHappy new year! ü•Ç If you found this helpful, check out my newsletter. I only share what I've personally tried, realized, failed at, and learned the hard way.\n\nhttps://t.co/A39nuNZqn9",

        "thread": "Communities are a focal point of cohort-based courses (CBCs). You can't just have a start and end date, and expect students to finish. You NEED community. \n\nSo how is community building different for CBCs vs other products? What are challenges unique to courses?\n\nRead on\n1/ Cohort-based courses have a start and end date. This sense of urgency (aka a deadline) is exactly what most of us need to get our shit together and focus.\n \nThis time bound element means you can't build community with a slow burn.\n2/ Like a Michael Bay movie where cars are blowing up in the first three minutes, there needs to be action right away.\n\nFor a 2 week course, if students are feeling cold 1 week in... 50% of the course is already over.\n3/ You need to help students trust each other, quickly and deeply, so they can get the full benefits of a cohort-based course.\n4/ Building trust between students empowers them to:\n \n- give feedback with generosity\n- receive feedback without being defensive\n- focus on improving, not posturing\n- have shared culture re: \"what it's like around here\"\n \nCommunity managers create that trust, but it's not easy.\n5/ Another layer of complexity that CBC community managers face is working across multiple courses.\n \nYou have to create communities *within* the course and *across* courses. For example, let's say you have courses on topics like design, writing, investing...\n6/ You need to manage students with a range of personas, values, and psychographics. Writing students might respond to diff tactics than investing students.\n \nFrom a content POV, you have to build community--without necessarily being a subject matter expert yourself.\n7/ Like a subreddit, each course can have a different culture. \n \nYou need to give enough space for students to co-create and let the community reveal itself... While giving enough structure and prompting so students aren't twiddling their thumbs.\n8/ And lastly, courses are *learning first, community second*\n \nCommunity without learning is hanging out with friends. For example, meetup groups, fellowships, or social gatherings. So course communities have to create camaraderie AND enable learning at the same time\n9/ If these sound like interesting challenges you‚Äôre eager to tackle, we're currently hiring for a Community Lead. This is an important role and we would love to meet you. Apply in the form here:\n \nhttps://t.co/j1jYrCznBZ",

You can have a well-designed Notion doc but if the actual content is not useful, it still doesn't add value. If you see a well-designed doc and think \"Ooh!\" don't assume it makes sense\nThis applies for Keynote decks, websites, or anything else where you rely on heuristics to pattern match and make mental shortcuts. I've been surprised by how a shiny good-looking doc actually had poor logic or no new insights. Read and vet it as you normally would.",
