        "thread": "Struggling to stay focused while studying? You're not alone.\n\nStudies show that ~49% of people feel like their attention span is shorter than it used to be.\n\nSo, I’m going to share my evidence-based framework to help you improve your focus 👇 https://t.co/19fJtTDFyu\n🧠 Part 1: Mindset\n\nAccording to research, focus is a skill that can be developed.\n\nIt's something that can be learned rather than something that is innate to us.\n\nAnd the way we develop the skill is to find ways to make our work fun and energising.\n1 - Do it with friends\n\nAt uni, I set up a club with my friends called The Pomodoro Society, so we could all work together.\n\nThis was very energising.\n\nTbh you don’t necessarily need to do this in person - I used to join a Zoom co-working group during lockdown, which was fun.\n2 - Frame it as an adventure\n\nEvery morning I ask myself ‘what's the adventure that I'm going on today?’\n\nIt could be to film a video or edit a chapter of my book.\n\nThis stuff may sound boring, but if I frame it as an adventure I usually approach work from a more positive angle.\n💪 Part 2: Technique\n\n1 - Try the Pomodoro technique.\n\nThere's a ton of evidence that shows our brain struggles to focus for long periods of time.\n\nI find 25 mins to be long enough to get a good amount of work done, but short enough to feel like a break isn’t far away.\n2 - Task switching\n\nIf you interrupt work to respond to notifications and emails there’s this ‘attentional residue’ that’s left from switching between tasks.\n\nSo, one thing I do before working is put my phone and Mac on to Do Not Disturb, which means I don’t see any notifications\n🌳 Part 3: environment\n\nIn short, we want to avoid distractions.\n\nHaving our phone next to us when working massively reduces our ability to focus.\n\nSo, the best thing you can do is leave your phone in a different room.\nBut, embrace welcome distractions.\n\nThese are good distractions.\n\nE.g. your kids come in wanting to talk about something or propping your door open at uni so your friends can stop by for a chat.\nSometimes distractions are a good thing, and we need to remember that life is more than just about trying to focus and be more productive.\nAlso, make your environment inspiring.\n\nWhen the environment around me is inspiring, I'm way more likely to focus.\n\nThat’s why I enjoy going to co-working spaces like WeWork becsuse other people around me are working, the vibe is good, and the design is nice.\n👫 Part 4: the human factor\n\nTo focus you need to prioritise the basics: rest, sleep, exercise, and nutrition.\n\nSo, if we’re going to sleep at 4am, eating a load of crap, and sitting at home all day then that’s going to masssively impact our ability to do decent work.\nAlso, caffeine is broadly great at helping us to focus too.\n\n(Unless you have really profound anxiety or tachycardia that's triggered by caffeine).\n\nHowever, don’t drink it after 2 or 3pm otherwise you may struggle to sleep.\nI recently published a video on evidence-based tips to improve your focus while studying, so feel free to check it out if you found this thread interesting:\n\nhttps://t.co/iqwsLwd5bP",

It opens up possibilities for business ideas in your mind, by helping you to notice how problem in day-to-day life can be solve using tech, and\n2. It helps you execute your ideas much faster than anyone else\nI’ve always been pretty good at coding ever since learning how to build websites to make some cash at school.\n\nBut, Brilliant has helped me keep that knowledge fresh for whenever I want to tweak the website or test new ideas\n\nI love the ‘Programming with Python’ course btw :) https://t.co/5mpH2dOGqb\n🤔 Problem Solving\n\nEverything we do involves solving problems - whether it’s at work, in relationships or just navigating life. So, having a good mental model of how to solve problems is such an important skill if we want to achieve some level of success and happiness.\nLuckily, Brilliant have a great course on this too!\n\nThere’s a bunch of fun problems and interactive puzzles to work through including a great set of matchstick problems for those who enjoy the mathematical side of problem solving too ;)\nThanks to @brilliantorg for sponsoring this thread!

        "thread": "My email newsletter has grown from 0 to 250,000 subscribers in the last 3 years.\n\nHere's my head of marketing to explain how we did it and how you can grow your newsletter no matter if you already have thousands of subscribers or you’re just starting 👇 https://t.co/dtyByX4Xeq\nHey team! My name is Jakub (@kliszczakjakub) and I’m a one-man marketing team in our YouTube business taking care of email marketing, course launches and promotion, marketing strategy, newsletter growth, content strategy, analytics, etc.\n@kliszczakjakub Over the last 2 years, I’ve been responsible for the growth of the entire mailing list including Sunday Snippets. Back when I joined the team, Sunday Snippets was a bit random (but very consistent!) weekly newsletter hosted on Revue.\n@kliszczakjakub The first thing I did was convert it into one of the best (if not the best) email marketing platforms for online creators, @ConvertKit\n\nIn an instant, we could create our own branded template, segment our audience, and create custom email flows and automations.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit If you want to start but you’re not sure platform which platform to choose, here’s a simple way to decide:\n\nDo you already have a significant audience on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn or another social media platform?\n\nYes: Choose @ConvertKit\nNo: Choose @SubstackInc\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc If you’re just starting out writing the first issue is the biggest hurdle. Substack removes all the friction and is the easiest way to start.\n\nBut it lacks many advanced features which is why established creators should choose ConvertKit. Even if it means a steeper learning curve\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc Before we dive any deeper, the first question you might have is why should you even start an email newsletter?\n\nA couple of reasons. 👇\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc 🔐 Control &amp; Safety\n\nGetting subscribers is great.\n\nBut what if YouTube or Twitter suddenly disappeared?\n\nYou’d lose your audience instantly.\n\nAn email newsletter lets you de-platform your audience and have actual control over it.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc 🤑 Monetisation\n\nOver the last two years, email has consistently generated over $1.5M+ in revenue a year.\n\nWe generated that through a combination of courses, sponsorships, and referral deals.\n\nPeople say that email is dead but email is stronger than it's ever been.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc 🔮 Future-proof your projects\n\nMost creators work on a product just to release it into an (uninterested) void. Don’t do that.\n\nInstead build an audience that you can always reach to get feedback, test concepts, and launch new projects.\n\nLet’s go back to creating your newsletter.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc The next question is “what do I write about?”\n\nAre you already creating content?\n\nYes: Let your email newsletter be an extension of your expertise. Share BTS moments, tell stories that you wouldn’t tell on your main platform, and promote your products.\n\nNo: Just start writing.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc 🗓️ Frequency?\n\nAlways start with a weekly newsletter.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc Okay, we have everything in place.\n\nNow, how do you grow? 📈\n\nStart simple and…\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc ♻️ Create a consistent social media promotion schedule\n\nIf you have a YouTube channel, plug it in your videos.\n\nIf you write on Twitter, turn your newsletter issues into a thread or visual.\n\nDon’t copy/paste. Repurpose it to the most appropriate format for each platform.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc 🏆 Earn the email\n\nCreating valuable content to get people on your email list is by far one of the best tactics.\n\nCreate so-called lead magnets. It can be a Notion template, PDF, checklist, or a free email course. Anything that gives value to your audience.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc For example, our Notion Productivity Templates generated over 10,000 subscribers.\n\nAnd our free, 7-day email course brought more than 25,000 additional signups.\n\nStart with the most popular piece of content and turn it into something useful and evergreen. https://t.co/BeboGdMCr7\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc 🌐 Leverage your website\n\nIt doesn’t sound sexy but SEO and content marketing are still a vital part of a newsletter growth strategy.\n\nIf you have a personal website, optimise it for signups. Add a pop-up and a welcome matt @noahkagan style. https://t.co/MBmDFV0ddN\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc @noahkagan 📢 Make your newsletter shareable\n\nKeep a public archive of your newsletter (example: https://t.co/3hTDlf3ibo) so people can easily send someone a link + incentivise people to share each issue.\n\n@GoodMarketingHQ does a great job on that front.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc @noahkagan @GoodMarketingHQ ⛰️ Use milestones\n\nGiveaways &amp; one-time events like webinars work great to promote your newsletter.\n\nIf you do it right, you won’t hurt your newsletter’s health. Aim to convert your audience that’s mostly on one platform to your email newsletter, i.e. YouTube → email newsletter.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc @noahkagan @GoodMarketingHQ The above list when combined with the weekly consistency is enough to get you to 100,000 subscribers or even beyond.\n\nOnce you find your winning tactic explore it as much as you can.\n\nOnly then try new things like launching a referral program or doing cross-promotions.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc @noahkagan @GoodMarketingHQ Lastly, if it all seems like much but you want to start an email newsletter I also run an agency https://t.co/JO1jdvrxVi\n\nWe do everything from writing your newsletter to managing the whole system and helping you monetise it. All with less than a day per year of your involvement.\n@kliszczakjakub @ConvertKit @SubstackInc @noahkagan @GoodMarketingHQ And to make it easier to start, you can use a discount code ALI20 that will get you 20% off your first purchase (no matter the plan you choose).",

        "thread": "If you want to grow a YouTube channel to 10k, 50k, 100k and more, you need systems.\n\nThis is the game-changing advice I give to anyone who's looking to start or build their YouTube channel 👇 https://t.co/Y6AozHehKK\nIf I could give one piece of advice to someone who wants to make it on YouTube, it would be this:\n\n👉 Create a system around your video production that stacks and creates repeatable habits, so it fits into your life and you stay consistent.\nIn the early scrappy days of my channel I did everything myself. But if you’re looking to do YouTube part-time then the closest thing to a magic bullet is a system.\n\nIt will allow you to grow your channel sustainably and to plug in other people when the time comes to have a team\nSystems are basically a set of processes that take us to our desired result.\n\nIn the words of @JamesClear: “Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.” Let’s assume that our goal is to get 100,000 subscribers.\n@JamesClear To reach 100,000 subscribers on YouTube you’ll need to:\n\n- Have a big list of video ideas\n- Write scripts that provide value for every video\n- Post at least one video a week for a year\n@JamesClear Consistency is the hardest part about a YouTube channel.\n\nBanking on motivation or willpower to grow your channel won’t cut it.\n\nThat’s why you should be trying to piece together repeatable processes that can become streamlined and/or automated over time.\n@JamesClear Without a system, you’ll be reinventing the wheel every time you film a new video.\n\nThis makes improving your videos that little bit more difficult, as there’s nothing standardised to build on top of as your foundation.\n@JamesClear In PTYA I share exactly how I grew my channel from 0 to 3 million subscribers while doing YouTube only part-time.\n\nBut the system doesn’t only help you grow your subscribers count. It also takes care of major challenges that a YouTuber has to face like 👇\n@JamesClear 🏗️ Building a team\n🎥 Dealing with cameras, mics, and lighting\n💡 Running out of ideas\n🎬 Structuring your videos...\n💰 Monetising your channel\n♻️ Repurposing your content\n✉️ Outsourcing content production To mention only a few.\n@JamesClear If you found this thread helpful, you might want to check out my Part-Time YouTuber Academy (enrolment closes this Friday btw):\n\nhttps://t.co/ud9xu76dkg",

        "thread": "If you’re curious about how a YouTube-based business makes and spends money, I’ve broken down our financials from January in this thread 🧵\nFor context: I’m thinking about sharing the finances behind the business every month for transparency plus I thought some people would find it interesting. So let me know if this is something that you’d like to see more of :p\n💰 January’s Revenue\n\nWe made £195,000 in Jan, which was slightly less than in 2022\n\nI’m v happy with this :)\n\nThe reason for the slight dip was mainly because we were ramping up for the launch of the Part-Time YouTuber Academy, so most of our attention has been on nailing that. https://t.co/NXPd25L2ao\nAs you can see, half of our money last month came directly from the YouTube stuff (main channel, second channel and deep dive) - with £50k coming from ad revenue and £45k from sponsors.\n😢 January’s costs\n\nThe total cost of sales was £38k, which is slightly better than in January 2022.\n\nWe’re putting a huge emphasis on improving the quality of our video content this year, which is why editing is the biggest cost here. https://t.co/RpZMEEqLkX\nTo make the Part-Time YouTuber Academy as amazing as possible we do pull in a few people to help out, which explains that cost\n\nEg we get student supporters to help with feedback, occasionally pay people to co-host sessions, and other things to make the experience world class\n💻  January’s Expenses\n\nThe cost of sales is the costs in delivering our ‘service(s)’ for that period of time.\n\nThe expenses are our ongoing expenses.\n\nAs expected, almost half of our £140k of expenses went into salaries. https://t.co/iDAKsXMBv3\nA good chunk of expenses is dedicated to ‘staff training’\n\nI really want everyone in my team to be a world expert at the thing that they do (e.g. editing / writing / etc), so I’m getting everyone on the team a personal coach to help with this goal.\nWe also had a major £17k outgoing expense for sales training, which should help us throughout the year, but was paid all in one go in January.\n💵 Overall Profitability\n\nGross profit (ie profits earned after subtracting the costs of producing and selling our products) = £156k\n\nOperating profit (i.e. money left after paying all business costs, except tax) = £15k https://t.co/CoxnAPeuED\nThe reason earnings are higher than our operating profit is because there are £35k of gains from investments the company has made, which is classed as ‘other income’ that comes after operating profit in the Profit &amp; Loss sheet.\n\nSo, we made ~£42k after tax in January overall :)\nIf there’s anything else you’d like to know drop a comment below 👇\n\nThanks to TSJ for doing this analysis for me! https://t.co/tSVNCXsZWi",

        "thread": "I’ve been on YouTube for around 5 years, and in that time I’ve made hundreds videos, spent thousands of hours filming/editing, and got ~4 million subscribers.\n\nHere’s 23 lessons to succeed on YouTube in 2023 👇 https://t.co/96lBY6k7rx\n🥊 1. Doing YouTube is hard.\n\nIf you get into it cause you think it’ll be easy money, reconsider your options.\n\nYou’ll find yourself sacrificing a lot and learning new skills before you actually see any results.\n\nYou just need to be patient and ride that wave 🌊\n🎨 2. Create, create, create.\n\nConsistency is King.\n\nForget about trying to find a viral hit when you start out.\n\nInstead, post 1 video per week consistently and your life will change.\n\nFocus on getting better, not bigger. Growth comes over time.\n👑 3. Compounding is Queen.\n\nIt took me 2-3 years of creating regular content before things really took off.\n\nFor Part-Time YouTuber Academy student @johncoogan, it was his 77th video that really accelerated his growth after having published videos every week for 18 months.\n@johncoogan 🎥 4. Gear doesn’t matter.\n\nIf you've got a phone, that's most of the job done.\n\nGetting your first video out is way more important than fancy quality.\n\nI’m a prime example.\n\nYou can watch my fearful first YouTube video from 2017 here:\n\nhttps://t.co/lpphCFQPAv\n@johncoogan 🎙️ 5. Prioritise audio.\n\nHave you ever sat through a video with bad audio?\n\nChances are you raced to turn it off.\n\nSo when you do upgrade your gear, prioritise getting a decent mic.\n\nPeople will sit through crappy video quality, but nobody will listen to bad audio.\n@johncoogan 🤬 6. Block out the haters.\n\nWhat other people think of you is none of your business.\n\nAs long as you’re having fun, that's all that matters.\n\nAs Eleanor Roosevelt famously said, “You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realised how seldom they do.”\n@johncoogan 🎬 7. Learn to edit.\n\nYou'll soon realise there's no way around it.\n\nEditing is just something you’ve got to learn.\n\nFor anybody starting out, I’ve got a free course on Skillshare you can take to get you up to speed: https://t.co/TWd4EmewGQ\n@johncoogan 💼 8. Outsource editing quickly.\n\nKnowing how to edit is great but it’s a HUGE time-sink.\n\nTry and outsource editing as soon as possible.\n\nUse sites like:\n- Upwork\n- PeoplePerHour\n- Fiverr\n- https://t.co/OB6BzaK92s\n\nI’ve used them all and we're now loving Clipt 🚀\n@johncoogan 📖 9. Learn to tell stories.\n\nStorytelling is super important.\n\nSo much so that I even hired author Matthew Dicks to be my storytelling coach to improve my own skills (his book Storyworthy is incredible)\n@johncoogan 💥 10. Niche down to blow up.\n\nIt’s a cliche but it’s true.\n\nIf you try to appeal to everyone and cover everything, you’ll appeal to no one and cover nothing (in-depth).\n@johncoogan ⛏️ 11. Architect vs Archaeologist.\n\nThere are two ways to find a niche.\n\nHere’s a thread I wrote on the difference 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/ziqwdNtp8Y\n@johncoogan 📚 12. Titles matter.\n\nVideo titles will make or break your video.\n\nSince realising this about 2 years ago, I insist that my team has AT LEAST 10 potential titles before we even think about creating a video.\n\nNo title, no video.\n@johncoogan 🖼️ 13. Thumbnails matter more.\n\nTbh, thumbnails are probably more important than titles.\n\nYour video won’t get watched if nobody clicks on it.\n\nFor more tips on thumbnails, check out my other thread here:\n\nhttps://t.co/igKt64h7xL\n@johncoogan 🧪 14. Test, test, test.\n\nYour first title or thumbnail might not be your best. A/B testing them is really easy with today’s tools and can really impact a video’s performance.\n\nWe use @Tubebuddy to have around 30+ tests running at once as it can make a massive difference.\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy ⚖️ 15. Leverage your content.\n\nOnce you’ve written a script, or made a video, it’s a no brainer.\n\nRepurpose this content into blog posts, newsletters, video clips and social media posts.\n\nIt’s super easy to do and helps build your audience on different platforms.\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 🍎 16. Branding isn’t just for Apple.\n\nEven though you might not think you’re a ‘brand’ in the traditional sense, channel branding is super important.\n\nIt ultimately gets you an audience and keeps you front of mind. https://t.co/CQ2ntfkuH9\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 🎣 17. Hooks are key.\n\nThe average human attention span is now eight seconds, less than a goldfish.\n\nIf your hook is bad, viewers will leave (and so will the goldfish).\n\nTitles + thumbnails earn the click, but you’ve got to keep people watching.\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 📈 18. Don’t blame the algorithm.\n\nLoads of people leap to blaming the algorithm when their video doesn’t perform.\n\nIn reality, it’s people who click on videos, not machines.\n\nIf your video’s not getting views it’s because it’s not making people click.\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 📊 19. Understand your analytics.\n\nThey can be confusing, but they tell you a lot about:\n\n- The type of videos you should be making\n- What’s working (or isn’t)\n- How you can improve\n\nI’ve done a thread on the most important metrics here 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/Ag0QFBZNk4\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 👀 20. Don’t chase views.\n\nI’ve fallen into the trap of getting obsessed with analytics, chasing views, chasing subscribers (not literally) and it’s never ended well.\n\nI even deleted a video last year because it just didn’t provide any valuable content.\n\nJust keep creating.\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 🎒 21. Batch record.\n\nThis is a simple but effective lesson.\n\nIt’s so much easier to spend 3-4 hours recording 3-4 videos than sitting down every week for one hour.\n\nOnce I realised that, it unlocked so much time and reduced a tonne of friction.\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 🔤 22. Concentrate on inputs.\n\nSubscribers and views are vanity metrics.\n\nIt’s way more important to just get one video out per week when you’re starting off.\n\nConsistency is key 🔑\n@johncoogan @TubeBuddy 🗞️ 23.

        "thread": "My 5 favourite productivity apps for the MacBook in 2023 👇\n1 - Alfred\n\nI install @alfredapp on every Mac I use because it’s so good.\n\nIt’s basically just a more powerful replacement for Apple’s Spotlight Search\nfeature. https://t.co/pwl4SY7Aj2\n@alfredapp A normal person would open an app by dragging their mouse to the dock, finding\nthe app, then clicking it.\n\nThis is a massive waste of time.\n\nWith Alfred, I just hit cmd + spacebar, type in the name of the app, and it\nopens it up immediately.\n@alfredapp 2 - Moom\n\nMoom is a tool that lets you use a keyboard shortcut to snap windows to either\nside of your screen.\n\nFor example, if I have a Google doc for my book open and I’m doing some research\nI can hit cmd + shift + M to quicky resize the windows to be in split screen\nview. https://t.co/hVFsBLR7g0\n@alfredapp 3 - Amphetamine\n\nThis is a super helpful tool that’s designed to keep your Mac on for as long as\nyou need it to.\n\nThis is particularly helpful when I’m rendering a file in Final Cut and I don't\nwant my Mac to go to sleep :p https://t.co/aqtoR37jFx\n@alfredapp 4 - Cleanshot X\n\nI use @CleanShot daily - it’s a great way of taking screenshots and screen\nrecordings.\n\nSo if I want to take a screenshot I just click the icon in the taskbar + hit\n‘capture area’\n\nThen it appears in the corner of the screen where I can do whatever I like with\nit\n@alfredapp @CleanShot One thing I often do is use the arrow tool to point to different things or add\ntext on top of the screenshot https://t.co/fwmQ02lVhv\n@alfredapp @CleanShot The other cool thing about Cleanshot is that it lets you do scrolling captures.\n\nThis basically lets you take a screenshot of a whole page, giving you a really\nreallly long screenshot like this: https://t.co/DT1sx6foDp\n@alfredapp @CleanShot 5 - Rize\n\n@rize_io is an automatic time tracker that tracks all the apps you’re using\nthroughout the day.\n\nI’ve been using this since Nov 2021, so I can quickly see how much time I’m\nspending on different areas of my life in a given week / month. https://t.co/4irgHYlndf\n@alfredapp @CleanShot @rize_io It's also got a Pomodoro Timer built into it.\n\nSo, if I’m working on a chapter of my book, I’ll hit ‘start focus’ to set my\ngoal, duration of the session, and some background music.\n\nA notification also pops up if it notices I'm getting distracted, which is cool\n:) https://t.co/6YJB3P8Y0O\n@alfredapp @CleanShot @rize_io If you want to see what other apps I use on my Mac in 2023, make sure you check\nout the full video over on the channel\n👉 https://t.co/oeR8qIPJTL",

        "thread": "My favourite browser in 2023 is @SigmaOS - it’s completely changed the game for my online productivity 🎉\n\nSo here are 6 ways it’s helped me to save time and get more done👇\n1 - Organisation\n\nI love how easy it is to organise + group my tabs into multiple workspaces depending on what I’m working on\n\nE.g. I've got a workspace for my creative work, a workspace for chill time, a workspace for the book etc\n\nHere's some research I’m doing for my book :) https://t.co/ugLV6GIsC9\nSigmaOS makes it very easy to get going because they give you a bunch of different template workspaces depending on whether you’re a student, startup, creator, etc\n\nI started off with a simple ‘creator’ workspace but I now have a workspace for pretty much every area of my life\n2 - Performance\n\nIt’s also a WebKit browser that’s compatible with Chrome extension - all this basically means is that you get all the performance / privacy benefits of Safari, combined with all the great tools of Chrome.\n\nSo it offers the best of both worlds imo 🎉\n3 - Multitasking\n\nI like doing multiple things at the same time eg chat to people on Slack while watching a video or taking notes while reading.\n\nSigma’s split screen function makes this super easy and saves me from having to jump between tabs + different browser windows.\n4 - Focus\n\nWhen I need to immerse myself in my work and avoid distractions I use 'focus mode' - I’ve used this a ton when writing my book\n\nIt basically hides everything except the current page I’m working on, so I can’t get distracted by thousands of YouTube notifications #flex\n5 - Lazy search\n\nI’ve always been a big fan of the idea that if you want to increase your overall digital productivity, you should switch to a keyboard-first approach and use your mouse and trackpad as rarely as possible.\n\nThis is why I love their Lazy Search feature.\nLazy Search lets me find pretty much everything I need - tabs, previous searches, bookmarks, etc. - all from one super easy to use search bar.\n\nPlus, Sigma has a ton of keyboard shortcuts that makes finding and doing what you need so much faster.\n6 - Aesthetics\n\nI’m always more productive when the environment is pretty, which is probably another reason why I’ve enjoyed Sigma so much.\n\nIt’s just a really nice aesthetic experience and it’s always so much fun using it compared to other browsers ❤️\nSo, if you’re interested in upgrading your browser to SigmaOS, they’re kindly offering 20% off the annual plan with the code Ali20: https://t.co/SdZEF3dnO2 \n\nI highly recommend you check it out and give it a go :)\nThanks to @SigmaOS for sponsoring this thread.",

        "thread": "I built a million dollar business in medical school.\n\nHere are my top 10 tips for entrepreneurs\n\n🧵\nContext: Back in 2013, my friends and I set up a business whilst we were medical students called 6med. When we started we thought it would just be a small-scale, local project – but a few months later we’d run 5 sold-out courses to over 120 students and it just continued to grow\n1 - Don’t wait for permission\n\nWhen we’re thinking of starting something we often wait for someone to give us permission to say we can start\n\nBut waiting won't help.\n\nYou can start doing it whenever you want and, in fact, the act of ‘doing’ is the best form of learning.\n2 - Stand on the shoulders of giants\n\nEntrepreneurship and business are not new phenomena.\n\nIt’s a well-trodden path and loads of people who've built grest businesses have shared what they've learnt through books / websites /podcasts / etc.\n\nSo learn from them.\n3 - Learn to code\n\nIt might sound slightly cliched now but knowing the basics of how to code is really valuable\n\nIt helps to open up your mind to potential video ideas and, when you have a decent idea, you can begin building it yourself.\n4 - Learn design basics\n\nI think one of the reasons our business was able to grow was because our website looked eye-catching and legitimate.\n\nBy developing your eye for design, you can add production value which has benefits for a vast array of things in life as well as business\n5 - Do it with friends\n\nThere’s a classic saying in start-ups: “If you want to go fast, you should go alone; if you want to go far, you should go together”\n\nI’ve found this to be completely true – it’s much more enjoyable to undertake projects with other people.\n6 - Start small\n\nIt’s very easy at the idea stage of a business to get ahead of yourself, overloading features and ultimately becoming overwhelmed very quickly.\n\nInstead, start small and, over time, using user feedback, add more iterations and improve the product in small ways\n7 - Do things that don’t scale\n\nWhat I mean by this, is not that you should design a product that won’t scale but when you are starting out, undertake actions that won’t scale to ensure customer satisfaction as well as build your customer base.\n8 - Expect and learn from failure\n\nThe truth is, the chances are v small that your start-up will succeed.\n\nI had 5 failed businesses at school, but it was going through those failures and learning from them that helped me come up with the BMAT crash course idea which led to 6med.\n9 - Ask yourself why\n\nWe should regularly ask ourselves why we are really doing what we have decided to do\n\n“Never forget why you are really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?” - Derek Sivers\n10 - Just start\n\nIf you’re interested in entrepreneurship the best thing you can do is just start. We can spend too long being fearful of being judged or, as with the first piece of advice, waiting for permission.\n\nSo just get going and see what happens :)\nIf you enjoyed this thread, you might enjoy my video on the same topic over here 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/RRtXnErrFo",

I’ve been experimenting with it to write sales page copy and it does a pretty decent job of suggesting different hero text, calls to action, and other persuasive copy.\n@brilliantorg 6 - Midjourney\n\nMidjourney is a tool that generates art using AI.\nIt’s a lot of fun and helps you get super creative with things like logo design, branding, and stuff like that.\n\nI asked it to create me as a Harry Potter character: https://t.co/QncbmQWYuB\n@brilliantorg 7 - Brilliant\n\nAs I mentioned, Brilliant is a great place to learn about how these tools work.\n\nTheir courses make understanding difficult topics like neural networks and AI super fun, quick and easy to follow.\n\nI highly recommend the ‘Artificial Neural Networks’ course btw 🙌\n@brilliantorg Thanks to @brilliantorg for sponsoring this thread!

What’s your goal and why? \nI'd suggest 1 video a week. It's important to decide what content you want to make and why, to motivate yourself. \n\n2. What tasks will help you get there?  \ni.e. research, scripting, filming, editing\n3. When will you get started? \nSet a date and calendar block those individual tasks. Be realistic but firm with yourself \n\n4. Start habit stacking - film multiple videos in one day, or scripting in your lunch break, for example \n\n5. Stay consistent + results will follow :)\nAll it takes to form a habit is a quick calendar shuffle and commitment to do the things. \n\nLike @JamesClear says: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\"\n@JamesClear If you're thinking of jumping in and taking YouTube seriously, check this out: https://t.co/vLHhUgxiOE\n\nThere are a few exec spots remaining!",

Yes\n- We're asking someone out? No, the worst that can happen is that we get rejected and life moves on.\n💡 The Spotlight Effect\n\nMost of us are worried that other people are judging us. \n\nBut, to be honest, nobody really cares what we’re doing. \n\nEveryone is too busy just getting on with their own life.\nI call this the NOC mindset (‘no one cares’) - whenever I’m struggling to start something because of this fear of social disapproval / rejection, I just remind myself that no one actually cares.\n2 - Self Perception Fears\n\nThis is the fear that we don’t want to start because we feel like we’re not good enough.\n\nThis is what I’d do if you’re in this position: lower the bar\n🫳 Lower the bar\n\nRecognise that when we start something new, we’re probably going to suck. And that’s totally okay.\n\nEg a big reason people don’t start YouTube channels is because they look at the pros and think ‘damn I can’t compete with that, so I won’t even start’\nSo, to begin with keep the bar low and just get going.\n\nThen once you’ve done the thing consistently, you can begin to raise the bar and aim for mastery.\nFor example, this is the process I'd use when starting out on YouTube: \n\nhttps://t.co/YE45S2rQDi\nIf you want to hear more about overcoming the fear of getting started, check out the full video:\n\nhttps://t.co/3RrENSs9YU",

        "thread": "If you’re struggling to stand out on YouTube, do this 👇\n1 - Understand your market\n\nIf you started a business, you’d do a bunch of market analysis before you launched.\n\nI think YouTube is very similar to running a biz, so it makes sense to do the same when starting a channel.\n\nResearch YouTubers in your niche + analyse their content.\n2 - Define your authentic edge\n\nThis isn’t about being better. But, being different.\n\nFor example, your edge could be:\n\nYou do deeper research.\nYou tell better stories.\nYou have better editing.\nYou’re more authentic and relatable.\n\nThere’s loads of ways to stand out in the market\n3 - Systematise\n\nIt takes a lots of time to do this YouTube thing well. Especially if you’ve got a full time job.\n\nYou’ve got to think of ideas, write scripts, edit, create thumbnails, etc.\n\nBut if you build systems and leverage then you can do YouTube in just 5-10 hours a week.\nRemember: consistency wins when it comes to being an online creator. \n\nSystems help to improve both the quality and quantity of your output.\nE.g. McDonald’s\n\nIf you go into a McDonald’s almost anywhere in the world you’ll get a near identical experience.\n\nThe reason? The systems and processes they have built are incredible.\n\nThey can hire any 16yo and they’ll give you the same result because their systems are so good.\nSo this is what I'd be thinking as a new YouTuber: \n\nHow can I build systems for my channel so I can 1) create valuable content in my niche that my audience finds interesting, 2) that’s strategically aligned to what I want to do, and 3) doesn’t take up large amounts of my time?\nIf you're looking to start your YouTube journey in 2023, I share a bunch of thoughts on how you can get going in this video 👇 \n\nhttps://t.co/ilw0E5DFYJ",

        "thread": "3 popular revision techniques you should avoid 👇 🧵\n1 - Rereading\n\nThis is the most popular technique people use because it gives us the impression that we’re engaging in productive work.\n\nBut, it isn’t productive or efficient.\n\nIt’s a passive form of learning.\nDunlosky: ‘When compared with other techniques, rereading is much less effective…The relative disadvantage of rereading to other techniques is the largest strike against rereading and is the factor that weighed most heavily in our decision to assign it a rating of low utility'\n2 - Highlighting\n\nThis also feels productive and allows our creative tendencies to (over)flow into making our notes look colourful.\n\nDunlosky: ‘highlighting does little to boost performance. It may actually hurt performance on higher-level tasks that require inference making’\nThis second point about inference is especially important.\n\nMany subjects at A-Level and university require some degree of making inferences. So, highlighting could be hindering our performance when tasked with making such inferences.\n3 - Summarising / making notes\n\nIf you know how to effectively make notes and summaries it can be useful, but most people don’t know how to do this.\n\nSo, making notes is probably less effective than we convince ourselves it can be.\nDunlosky: ‘We rate summarization as low utility. It can be an effective learning strategy for learners who are already skilled at summarizing; however, many learners will require extensive training, which makes this strategy less feasible’\nThis isn't to say that making notes is a complete waste of time – it can sometimes make revision fun.\n\nBut we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that it's 100% effective – just because we're writing things down, doesn’t mean we're making the best use of our revision time.\nIf you want to learn more about the best and worst ways to revise, check out my video from a few years ago on evidence based reivsion tips : https://t.co/WMRtWQYA2Q",

        "thread": "I asked 5 millionaires how they got rich \n\n(Thread 🧵)\n1. Invest in yourself first (cc @AlexHormozi)\n\nInstead of investing in the S&amp;P, invest in the S&amp;ME. \n\nThe S&amp;P will give you ~7% returns. But investing in yourself (through courses / books / etc) will return much more.\n\nEg a course on copywriting can lend you a well paying client\n2. Find work at a startup (cc @DanielPriestley)\n\nDaniel says that if anyone's trying to become an entrepreneur there's incredible value in joining a startup first.\n\nYou'll learn far more about the world of business than working for a much larger company.\n3. Take the third door (cc @TimArmoo)\n\nBefore starting the business he sold at 27 years old for $20M+, Timo got access to a conference with @garyvee  and @richardbranson  by asking the event organiser if he could help stack the chairs.\nTakeaway: in life you can either pay to access stuff, be rich enough to access stuff, or be smart enough to find another way (using the third door.)\n4. Everything's downstream of lead generation\n\nIf you want to sell well, you need to generate signals of interest from the market (eg by getting people to attend a free event or accessing a free product).\n\nIn short, a great business will fail without leads.\n5 - Extraordinary results require extraordinary inputs (cc  @Mrwhosetheboss)\n\nArun takes ~8 days to script a video, which directly translates into his success on YouTube. \n\nIt's so hard to compete with someone that spends that much time on trying to succeed.\n\"Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect\" - Teller\nIf you enjoyed these tips, you might like the full video over on the channel: https://t.co/euxQnNFenS",

        "thread": "My approach to making YouTube videos has changed a lot over the last 5 years. Here’s what I’ve learned about crafting the perfect script 👇\nI typically consider 5 core factors that go into my scripts:\n\n1. Fast, Bad, Wrong\n2. Adding A-roll and Voiceovers \n3. Minimising repetition \n4. Adding flair \n5. Creating intellectual property\n1. Fast, Bad, Wrong (FBR) \n\nWe all have unfair advantages that we can tap into. \n\nMost of us let perfectionism creep in before we even get started with filming videos. \n\nMy best advice is to outline the 5-7 points you want to talk about super quickly and refine the script later.\n2. Adding A-roll and Voiceovers \n\nAs you script your video, think about ways you can spice things up. \n\nWhen I first started YouTube, I recorded a bunch of random B-Roll clips in one sitting - flicking through books, scrolling on the iPad etc. \n\nI still use them to this day.\n3. Minimising repetition \n\nIt's normal to want to summarise things at the end of a point, but this will probably make your viewers bored and result in them clicking away.\n\nClearly define each point and the key message in your script, and try to train yourself into sticking to it.\n4. Adding flair \n\nAs we grow as creators, our audience becomes more interested in our personality. \n\nThink about how you can present value in a different way that's memorable:\n \n- Give a structure a new name\n- Add funny headings to your steps\n- Use familiar objects in B-Roll\n5. Creating intellectual property \n\nGiving a simple concept a name gives it power and will benefit the user by helping the concept to stick in their mind. \n\nIf you’re successful in this, people will talk about that structure with the name you gave it.\nThis worked when I shared how I use Notion as my “Resonance Calendar”: https://t.co/UvVhjnmRVb\nBonus tip 💫 - Visualise concepts \n\nWhen writing your script, stop to consider if it would be easier to show something, rather than just talk about. \n\nThis could be having a book to hand that you pick up, or dropping images into the video when it comes to editing\nWhatever it is, this will really help to keep the viewer engaged to the end.\nIf you found this helpful, why not learn the other frameworks I teach to budding YouTubers in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nSign up here 👉 https://t.co/vLHhUgxiOE",

Get Going\n\nThe biggest resistance to success is just getting started.\n\nYou're probably using one of these 3 things as an excuse to not start:\n\n• You’re worried what people will say\n• You don't have the equipment\n• You’re not sure what video to make first\nAll you have to do is turn your thinking around.\n\n• No one actually cares, they'll probably think it’s cool\n• You literally need a phone camera to start\n• You can make videos about anything, and at the start, you should\nJust start by making one video.\n\nOnce you've made one video, try to make one video a week.\n\nBe okay with publishing one video at a time and don’t worry about the bigger picture or the quality until later on.\n2. Get Good\n\nThe more we create YouTube videos, the better they will be.\n\nMy answer to the content quality vs. quantity debate is that quantity leads to quality.\n\nIt’s important to know what stage you’re in with your channel, so you can direct time and energy to what’s needed.\n3. Get Smart\n\nUntil you're posting regular videos, don’t worry about niching down your channel.\n\nYou'll get a better return if you focus more on making good videos and less time on planning the future of your channel. Use great sites like @fiverr to find freelance support.\n@fiverr Want to follow more structures for how to improve on YouTube?\n\nWe've just launched cohort 8 of the Part-Time YouTuber Academy.

This could be sharing a tweet or putting up a quick Instagram Story.\n\nIf you don’t have an audience, ask friends and family what they’d like to know about the subject you're interested to talk about.\nB → The Birdsong Technique\n\nWhen you're a content consumer, you passively enjoy the things that other people have created.\n\nWhen you become a creator, you’ll realise that ideas are everywhere. Your Twitter feed is no longer a wave of text - it’s thoughts, concepts and lessons.\nYou should keep up to date with both like-minded and different YouTubers in the mindset of a creator - once we begin to appreciate filmmaking, we tune in and find inspiration. Steal like an Artist and all that.\nKeep a slip file of things that spark your interest or that you'd like to learn how to recreate, and revisit this when you're researching and scripting for a video.\n\nThe same thing can apply to writers, podcasters, and any creative medium.\nC → Coal Mining\n\nA coal mine is an area where you're likely to find coal (i.e. video ideas) if you start digging.\n\nThis coal can then be used to create diamonds (i.e. banging video content).\nCoal mines could be Twitter lists, Reddit threads, Instagram pages, newsletters and even other YouTube channels.\n\nWhenever you find one of these mines, make a note of the link and refer back to it whenever you’re feeling short of ideas.\nCoal mining isn’t about plagiarising or copying content, it’s about taking inspiration to create your own stuff.\n\nIn the words of one of my favourite authors @austinkleon: “nothing is original”.\n\nI’d recommend reading Steal Like An Artist for more about this topic. https://t.co/kV0v0qGDmZ\n@austinkleon The ABC method is only as good as the system behind it.\n\nIf you don't have a system to properly store/capture your ideas you're only going to forget them: https://t.co/TLiU4ikTMB\n@austinkleon Without enough ideas for YouTube videos, you’ll stop publishing consistently.\n\nIf you found this thread helpful, why not learn the other frameworks I teach to budding creators in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nWe’ve just launched the FINAL cohort 👉 https://t.co/vLHhUgxiOE",

Here's a simple formula to end it once and for all.\n👨‍💻 Action leads to motivation\n\nI used to think you need motivation to get something done, but actually it's the other way around. You get stuff done, and the motivation naturally follows.\n\nAs @jeff_haden says: \"Motivation is not the cause of action, it is the result of action\"\n@jeff_haden 🛑 Stop thinking about motivation\n\nInstead of thinking about motivation, I like to think in terms of discipline. When we are disciplined, we will repeat an action enough so it becomes a habit.\n\nWe don't need motivation when it's a habit.\n@jeff_haden 🚀 Momentum carries you forward\n\nMost of the resistance that we feel when doing a task is in the act of starting.\n\nAs soon as we cross the action line, the pain of procrastination begins to go down.\n@jeff_haden 😴 Struggling to get started? Try this:\n\n2-minute rule - if a task can be done in &lt; 2 mins, do it now.\n\n5-minute rule - if I'm procrastinating, I have 5 mins to stop.\n\nMind activation rule - if I can't be bothered to do anything, I'll do something to wake up e.g. drink coffee\n@jeff_haden If you want to hear more about my formula to stop procrastinating, I made a video that you're more than welcome to check out 👉 https://t.co/8AVXcP3M9Y\n\nOr you can get more of these wannabe productivity guru threads by following me, @AliAbdaal\n@jeff_haden TL;DR\n\n1. Our present self loves short-term, instant gratification\n2. Procrastination is all about managing negative moods\n3. Motivation isn't the cause of action, it's the result of action\n4. Discipline is more important than motivation\n5. Getting started is the hardest part",

You make more money than you would at a local service job.\n2. It shouldn't feel like work.\n3. It should be flexible, allowing you to work when you want.\nThe key law for making money on the internet: money is an exchange of value. If you want to make money you need to provide value to people who are willing to pay you for said value.\n\nNo value means no money.\nWhat does this mean?\n\nFirst, learn a skill that people are willing to pay for.\n\nSecond, find people who are willing to pay for that skill.\n\nThat's the formula for making lots of money on the internet.\n\nSo, here are 7 valuable skills you can begin learning and selling today:\n1 - Content Writer\n\nPretty much every business in the world needs a content writer.\n\nIt could be local businesses, creators like me, or anyone in between.\n\nEg I know people who charge $1000 for a single script for a YouTube video.\nWant to get started? Become a Permissionless Apprentice (cc @jackbutcher)\n\nDo work for business/people for free and show them your work.\n\nIf you do a decent job people will queue up to hire you.\n@jackbutcher 2 - Sales Copywriter\n\nAnytime someone wants to sell something they'll have a webpage giving you all the information about the product.\n\nSo, if you enjoy writing / sales / marketing then this is pretty fun.\n\nPlus, the ROI is clear to businesses: better copy = more sales\n@jackbutcher Here are 5 book recommendations for wannabe sales copywriters:\n1. Expert Secrets (by @russellbrunson)\n2. Traffic Secrets \n3. Dotcom Secrets\n4. $100M Offers (by @AlexHormozi)\n5. Copywriting Secrets (by Jim Edwards)\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi 3 - Thumbnail Designer\n\nEvery YouTuber knos how important thumbnails are, so if you have a decent eye for aesthetics and know graphic design then this is pretty profitable.\n\nIf someone redesigns my thumbnails and they're better than what I can do I'll literally hire you today 😂\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi 4 - Website Designer\n\nThis is how I made money online at 13y/o.\n\nI found this easy because most web designers out there are either 1) not very good or 2) bad at marketing their services to the right people in the right format.\n\nAgain, be a Permisionless Apprentice.\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi Example: @hencubed taught himself how to design + build websites in 6 months during the pandemic. I was blown away by his work and have worked with him on multiple projects over the last year.\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi @hencubed 5 - Short form video editor\n\nBasically every business is looking into video content. Especially short form video with the whole Tik Tok / Insta reel / YouTube shorts thing.\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi @hencubed Example - @Juanico__ DM'd @dickiebush (who runs Ship 30 For 30) saying he'd edit his next 3 videos for free. He now works with Dickie as his video editor by just following the Permissionless Apprentice model.\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi @hencubed @Juanico__ @dickiebush 6 - Solopreneur's Personal Assistant\n\nIf there are people out there you'd like to work for (creators, businesses, etc) you can offer to be their second pair of hands.\n\nEg @JamesClear has 1 person on his team who manages everything, helps with content, and runs the operations.\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi @hencubed @Juanico__ @dickiebush @JamesClear 7 - 1-Man Video production Agency\n\nEvery business is looking to create video content (not just short form).\n\nIf you can offer a 1-man video production agency where you shoot, edit, and do everything for them you'll unlock a ton of opportunities\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi @hencubed @Juanico__ @dickiebush @JamesClear If you need some help getting started, feel free to check out my video editing course on Skillshare: https://t.co/wEzVPWjTkx\n@jackbutcher @russellbrunson @AlexHormozi @hencubed @Juanico__ @dickiebush @JamesClear TL;DR\n\nIf you want to begin making money on the internet, here are 7 great places to start:\n1.

        "thread": "The book that changed my relationship with money - 'Your Money or Your Life' by @vicki_robin\n\nHere's what I learnt 🧵👇\n@vicki_robin 💼 Redefining work\n\nWe're not really making a living from work. We're making a dying.\n\nIn other words, we waste a lot of energy on our jobs in the hope they'll bring us meaning, joy, and happiness. Even though we can get this by spending more time with friends + family.\n@vicki_robin 💰 What is enough?\n\n\"Enough is like the horizon - always receding\"\n\nWe often associate more money with increased levels of fulfilment. But at some stage the more we accumulate the less satisfaction we get - this is the fulfilment curve.\n@vicki_robin ⚡️ Money = life energy\n\nMoney is what we exchange our life energy for. And our life energy is the precious hours of life available to us.\n\nSo everything we buy is equivalent to hours of life energy we've given up e.g an $800 iPad = 80hrs of life energy if our job paid $10ph\n@vicki_robin 🔑 3 key questions about life energy\n\n1. Did I receive fulfilment, satisfaction + value in proportion to the life energy spent?\n2. Is this expenditure of life energy aligned with my values + life purpose?\n3. How might this expenditure change if I didn't have to work for money?\n@vicki_robin The book is full of really interesting info about how we think about money, leisure, meaning and all that kind of stuff. So make sure you check out the full video 👉 https://t.co/sZgE3IWyu2\n\nAnd drop me a cheeky follow - @AliAbdaal - if you enjoyed reading this thread.\n@vicki_robin TL;DR\n\n1. Our job doesn't really give us much fulfilment.\n2. At some point, earning more money doesn't make us more satisfied.\n3. Everything we buy is equivalent to hours of life energy given up.\n4. Always ask: is this purchase satisfying or aligned with my values?",

First, it helps you figure out what main thing you actually want to get done that day so you can be more intentional about how you’re spending your time. 2/5\nAnd second, the framing of ‘adventure’ helps you approach it in the spirit of **play**. You’re basically asking yourself ‘what’s my most important task’ but you’re doing it in a way that reminds your brain not to treat it too seriously. 3/5\nAnd IF you can approach your task in the spirit of PLAY, now all of a sudden it’s become much more enjoyable and energising, and you won’t struggle so much with motivation and focus. 4/5\nI do this every morning and it’s helped me be more productive in a way that’s fun and sustainable.

You've got to set out your why at the very beginning.”\n\nStories are engaging and memorable.\n\nIf you want people to care about what you’re doing, tell them why it’s important.\n@max_fosh 2 - Take the audience with you\n\n“I think my audience enjoys the feeling that they're doing this thing with me.”\n\nOnce you’ve told your audience why what you’re doing is important, take them on a journey.\n\nLet them see the ups and downs of what you’re doing and thinking.\n@max_fosh 3 - Start at the end\n\n“I normally start with the big ending”\n\nHook your audience with a flashy 30 seconds that intrigues, entertains or surprises them.\n\nMax does this by showing the best bits from the video straight away, like in this video here: https://t.co/4Mmw9I8zV7\n@max_fosh 4 - The exposition\n\n“The exposition is explaining a little bit more about why you're doing it and how you're going to do it.”\n\nAfter hooking the audience, they need context and explanation. Without this context the rest of the video can feel confusing and you'll lose the viewer.\n@max_fosh 5 - Pacing\n\n“Classical music is fantastic… It tells a story.”\n\nMax uses classical music to keep the viewer engaged and keep the pacing correct.\n\nHigh tempo / crescendo = entertaining shots.\nSlow tempo = explanation shots.\n@max_fosh 6 - Collaborate\n\n“I’m part of a Discord group where we roast each other’s titles and thumbnails... I'm now better at understanding how YouTube works”\n\nFind people who've got the same goals as you + share whatever you’re thinking about.\n\nIt helps to have a second opinion on stuff.\n@max_fosh 7 - Make it fun\n\n“I think the sudden boom [in the channel’s growth] is genuinely because I just had someone to talk to, speak about good ideas, and share my successes and failures. It made it so much more enjoyable”\n@max_fosh Check out Max's channel here: https://t.co/McJF0y9kj8\n\nAnd feel free to listen to our chat too: https://t.co/f7jjLrSw7e\n\nEnjoy x",

        "thread": "Your phone is killing your productivity.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on how to stop this from happening🧵\n😬 Unwelcome distractions\n\nPhones are largely an ‘unwelcome distractions’ - they use up our attention without permission.\n\nEg a notificaiton on our phone or an unexpected call.\n\nWe didn’t plan to be distracted, but we are anyway.\n❤️ Welcome distractions\n\nPhones can ocassionally be 'welcome distractions'. Like, when we get a phone call from a loved one.\n\nIt’s something we look forward to and adds value to our life.\n\nWe should only allow distractions when they’re ‘welcome’.\nTip 1 - Do not disturb\n\nIf you’re studying or doing something that needs you to focus, turn your phone to ‘Do Not Disturb’ and put it face down.\n\nIf your phone isn’t buzzing or making any noise you’ll think about it less.\nTip 2 - Throw away the phone\n\nNot literally lol. But, if you’re reallly desperate put the phone in a completely different room where you can’t easily grab it.\n\nIf our phone is next to us it’s annoyingly easy to just pick it up out of habit.\nTip 3 - Add friction\n\nIncrease the amount of friction it takes to do bad things in your phone.\n\neg my brother once uninstalled Instagram from his phone, so to use it he had to go on Safari and login there instead. That was supposedly enough friction to make him not go on it.\nTip 4 - Audit your time\n\nPeter Drucker said something like ‘what gets measured gets managed’.\n\nBasically, if we want to stop wasting time, we need to know how we’re spending our time.\n\nTip: check the ‘screen time’ on your phone and challenge yourself to reduce it every week.\nTip 5 - Productivity apps\n\nSome apps can help us to stay productive.\n\nOne app I quite like is @one_sec_app - this forces me to wait whenever I open up my socials. Often I can’t be bothered to wait so I click off and carry on doing whatever I was supposed to be doing lol.\n@one_sec_app Tip 5 - Make it unappealing\n\nOur brains are addicted to anything bright and shiny, so companies like to make our phones as bright / fun as possible to keep us coming back.\n\nTip: set your phone to greyscale mode to make using your phone less exciting.\n@one_sec_app I'm curious, what tips do you have to avoid getting distracted by your phone?",

But this probably isn’t true.\n\nMy advice: ask yourself ‘will this be interesting/useful to at least 1 person in the world?’. If yes, share it.\n\"The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.\" - Annie Dillard\nConcern 2 - \"I'm not good enough to write about this\"\n\nWe don’t need to be an expert to share what we’ve done, lessons we’ve had, or the stuf we’ve experienced.\n\ntbh beginners can often explain concepts better than an expert could.\n“The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten” - C.S. Lewis\nConcern 3 - \"People will think I’m really self-centred if I’m writing about my own life\"\n\nThe vast majority of people don’t think about you at all, let alone think that you’re self-centered. \n\nBut even if people do end up thinking that, the obvious response is ‘so what?’\nEleanor Roosevelt has been quoted on this topic so often that, somewhat ironically, I almost feel bad about quoting her here lol:  “You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.” -Eleanor Roosevelt\nWhat would you write about if you started a blog today?\n\nFeel free to check out my website if you want some inspiration or just want to read some stuff about productivity / youtubing / studying etc.\n\nhttps://t.co/0cqaBpICo9",

        "thread": "Here are 7 evidence-based techniques to find a career you genuinely love 👇\n1 - Task over title\n\nIf you focus too much on the title of the job (eg neurosurgeon) you can actually forget about what the day-to-day of that job involves. \n\nIt’s probably not as glamorous as you think.\n\nTip: think about whether you'd genuinely enjoy the daily tasks of the role.\n2 - Visualise your me+\n\nThe idea is that you should have a good understanding of the version of yourself you aspire to be. \n\nStep 1: define what your future self would ideally be doing. \n\nStep 2: define what sort of activities you’ll be engaged with e.g. consulting, writing, etc. https://t.co/O1VUm8kguX\n3 - Audit your time\n\nDuring the week write down what you’re doing and decide whether or not those things are taking you towards your me+\n\nIf something is actively taking you away from where you want to be, then you label it ‘- -‘\n\nThese are the things we want to avoid doing. https://t.co/sCcC6GnZ6R\n4 - Invest 13 minutes a day\n\nWe want to invest in activities that bring us closer to our dream career, even if it’s just 13 minutes a day. \n\nIt doesn’t sound like much, but it’s enough for our skills and abilities to compound over time.\n5 - You probably don’t need to go back to uni\n\nGenerally, I recommend people go to uni at some point as it gives you backup options.\n\nBut, don’t necessarily default to thinking that it's something you need to do because you can learn almost anything on the internet or in a book.\n6 - Embrace u-turns\n\nWe’re pretty bad at estimating what our future preferences are going to be eg 10 years ago I wanted to be a doctor, but now I make videos on the internet.\n\nSo if you decide you want to make a career u-turn, it’s probably a good thing.\n7 - The grid search mindset\n\nIf you don’t have a clear vision about what kind of career you’d enjoy, write down what activities you enjoy in a grid. Then see whether you’re doing things day-to-day that you find fun + are moving you closer to your dream career. https://t.co/952XqG9EXS\nIf you found this thread helpful, you might like the video I made on finding a career you love that goes into each of these points in more depth\n\nMake sure to follow me here @AliAbdaal for daily tweets on how to build a life you love too xx\n\nhttps://t.co/mMyZliHdkv",

        "thread": "This is why I think everyone should start an email newsletter.\n\nIt could be the best decision you make as a creator👇\n1 - It’s completely free to start\n\nAnyone could start a newsletter for $0 today, but the same can’t be said for other platforms like YouTube where a level of equipment is required. \n\nThe vast majority have access to a computer or phone, and some ideas to get started with.\n2 - It’s very low friction\n\nYes, you can get fancy with your newsletter and add a load of bells and whistles if you want to, but as it’s mostly about the value you provide through your writing. \n\nA lot of successful newsletters start out as a few paragraphs of text each week.\n3 - It’s private, kind of\n\nRealistically 100’s of people aren’t going to come pouring in as soon as you launch your newsletter (unless you already have an audience) so it’s a good way to whet your appetite for the whole creator, sharing your thoughts thing.\n4 - It’s all about writing\n\nIf you ultimately want to become good at the whole creator thing, you’re going to need to be a great writer. The best YouTube videos, tweet threads and TikTok’s all have great writing behind them.\nA weekly newsletter is a great way to practice and develop your writing style. It’s also a great way to figure yourself out more.\n\nI treat mine a lot like a weekly diary and I think that level of transparency is what people want to read these days.\n5 - You own the audience\n\nOn YouTube, I technically don’t own my audience. If it disappeared tomorrow it would be all gone.\n\nBut when you build an email list, you own that data and have a direct line to your audience, which can make for a more stable income.\nTo give you an idea of how this can go, I've built my newsletter up over a number of years, and made $2 million from selling my PTYA course primarily through my newsletter.\n@businessbarista , who I spoke to on the Deep Dive podcast, started his newsletter called Morning Brew in his University dorm room. After a lot of consistency and 5 years later, he sold it for $70 million.\n\nhttps://t.co/NkCMvRSq5S\n@businessbarista This isn’t an easy point to get to and obviously won’t happen for everyone, but I’m highlighting the potential of something as simple as an email newsletter.\n@businessbarista If you're ready to start but don't know how, I made a video explaining it which will help you decide on what to write and hopefully get your first newsletter out: https://t.co/D8WAiXorAV\n@businessbarista And, if you’re intrigued and want to subscribe to my newsletter Sunday Snippets to see what it’s all about, feel free: https://t.co/3hTDlf3ibo",

        "thread": "Here are 10 time management tips that I genuinely use day-to-day 🧵\n1 - We own all of our time\n\nWe can easily slip into this weird relationship with time, where we feel like we’re racing against the clock to get things done. Realising that we own our own time is a powerful shift.\nInstead of saying ‘I don’t have time’, say ‘I’m choosing to do this task now, and that task later’. It gives you back control over what you spend time on and can help you prioritise better.\n\nhttps://t.co/N72EsvjQnw\n2 - Hell yeah or no\n\nA very simple mental model coined by Derek @sivers to help you make better decisions.\n\nWhen we’re young, there’s more value in saying yes to pretty much every opportunity that comes our way.\n@sivers But as we progress in life and in our careers, we start getting more opportunities and it’s impossible to say yes to them all.\n\nThe way to counter that is to make decisions by saying either ‘hell yeah’ or ‘hell no’. If it’s not a ‘hell yeah’ straight away, we should let it pass.\n@sivers 3 - The daily highlight\n\nThis is straight from my favourite productivity book ‘Make Time’ by John Zeratsky @jazer\n\nThe idea is that each day, we choose one specific task that we want to get done, simply saving us from an overly long to-do list and analysis paralysis.\n@sivers @jazer 4 - Use a to-do list\n\nThere’s so much going on in our brain every day, there’s no way we can store a perfect list of everything we need to do.\n\nDo yourself a favour and keep a daily checklist of tasks so you can stay on track.\n@sivers @jazer Having a physical to-do list in front of your eyes is a really pleasant experience and you’re less likely to switch away from an app and never check it again.\n\nIf you’re looking for a new to-do list or planner, mine are currently 50% off: https://t.co/db4AiyWV40\n@sivers @jazer 5 - Time blocking\n\nWhenever we have a task to do we should put a time block in our calendar just for this thing - it really is as simple as it sounds\n\nI like to use this technique in combination with the daily highlight to make sure the most important task is protected in my cal.\n@sivers @jazer 6 - Parkinson’s Law\n\nParkinson’s Law states that work expands to fill the time we allocate to it.\n@elonmusk set’s himself incredibly short deadlines so, even if he doesn’t finish the whole task, he’s gotten ahead with some progress.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk To take advantage of Parkinson’s Law we need to leverage deadlines, even if they’re somewhat artificial. Putting pressure on when you need to get a task done by will help you tick it off.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk If you want to learn more about the laws of productivity, I have a Skillshare class on it here: https://t.co/ZwzCS4jB4t\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk 7 - Protected time\n\nIf you don't protect your time, your day can easily get filled up with meetings. Schedule a block of your day for protected task time.\n\nThese days I set my protected time for the first 4 hours of my mornings and I use it to write my book.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk 8 - Delegation\n\nWhen most people hear about delegation their instant response is “I don’t have enough money.” And I get it. It’s a valid concern.\n\nThe way I got over that doubt was by setting a fixed hourly rate. A dollar value of my time.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk Back when I was starting my first business, I decided that an hour of my time would be worth $20.\n\nIf something could be delegated for cheaper, I’d use services like Fiverr to hire freelancers who were more than happy to do things like data entry or video editing.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk 9 - Automated scheduling\n\nWith different time zones and calendars, scheduling a single meeting can take up to 20 minutes.\n\nAt some point, this became too much trouble so I decided to try out some kind of scheduling software - I settled on the Calendly and have never looked back.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk 10 - The choice to be satisfied\n\nThe last tip is more philosophical. For us productivity nerds, it’s easy to feel dissatisfied at the end of the day.\n\nWe can either stress out about the things we haven’t managed to do or choose to be satisfied with the work we’ve done.\n@sivers @jazer @elonmusk Choosing to be satisfied will likely have a more positive impact on our behaviour and performance the next day.\n\nIf you’re interested in this topic and want to hear more, I have a video on how I manage my time: https://t.co/OcD0HGOjRM",

        "thread": "These are the 15 best books I read last year 👇\n1. The Pathless Path - @p_millerd \n\nNo joke, I kept 10 copies of this book last year and gifted it to all my friends. \n\nIf you’re struggling to figure out what’s next in your career / not sure if you should follow the default path, Paul has some brilliant advice for you.\n2. Someday is Today - @MatthewDicks\n\nThis is a great book to read if you have some creative life goals, but keep putting off the ‘getting started’ part. \n\nMatthew is a great storyteller and I’ve learned a heck of a lot from his perspective on life.\n3. Beyond Wealth - Alexander Green \n\nHaving spent a lifetime working in investment advice and the finance field, Alexander compiled a load of lessons he’s learned about what’s actually important in life, beyond the money.\nI thought it might have had the usual ‘spend more time with the ones you love’ and ‘work less’ self-help advice, but he really explores a lot arts, politics, history, philosophy and culture, which prompted me to dive deeper into those things myself.\n4. The 3 Alarms - @Eric_Partaker\n\nThis book has given me three pieces of really practical advice that I’ve been using since I read it. \n\n1⃣The concept of the 3 alarms - I’ve got 3 alarms set in my phone that remind me of who I want to be at different points of the day\n2⃣The ideal week - me and my team did this exercise by figuring out what our ideal weeks looked like, and then blocked our calendars out to make it happen \n\n3⃣The weekly review - most weeks I look back on and review my week using the method Eric describes in the book\n5. The Art of Business Of Online Writing - @Nicolascole77\n\nIf anyone I meet says they want to earn money from the internet, I suggest this book to them. Nicolas went from pro World of Warcraft gamer to being paid to write online, a super interesting shift.\n6. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - @StephenRCovey\n\nThis book has over 40 million copies sold and is such a staple in the productivity / self-help space. I’d put off reading it for a while as I’d seen a few summaries of it, but I’m glad I finally picked it up last year\nA large part of the book is all about emotional intelligence and appreciating the empathetic ingredients you need to ‘live a good life’. It’s incredible and worth reading cover to cover.\n7. Scorecard Marketing - @DanielPriestley  \n\nA short, easy and tactical read by my friend Daniel. \n\nIf you run a business or are interested in starting one, this book will enable you to better understand your audience and sell to them effectively.\n8. What We Owe The Future - @willmacaskill\n\nI’ve done a book club episode on this (linked below) but in short, it explores the idea of longtermism. A good one if you’re interested in levelling up your understanding of different areas of philosophy. \n\nhttps://t.co/UVjFi7QTbQ\n9. The Go-Giver - Bob Burg &amp; John David Mann \n\nEssentially a short fable about business and life. It was gifted to me by @TintinSmith from my team, and I enjoyed every second of it. If you want something super accessible that will get the cogs turning, I’d highly recommend.\n10. The Luck Factor - @RichardWiseman\n\nI first read this when I was about 16 years old, when I was getting into magic and personal development. When we were reaching out to guests for the pod, I knew I wanted to chat with Richard because the book had a big impact on my life\nYou can catch the podcast episode here: https://t.co/JHv57iH2BG\n11. The Way of the Superior Man - David Deida \n\nI picked up this book from watching @HamzaAdonis, as he kept raving on about it. I was a little sceptical at first but I think it’s actually a pretty helpful read.\n12. $100M Offers - @AlexHormozi  \n\nI’ve been levelling up a lot of my business knowledge this past year and I’d actually say this should be required reading for anyone looking to frame their offer and sell better.\n13. Sapiens - @harari_yuval\n\nI finally read this book this year (I feel like everyone I know has this on their bookshelf) and it was really really good. I’ve been trying to learn more about history and I feel like this was a brilliant starting point.\n14. The Surrender Experiment - Michael A. Singer \n\nMichael decided, in his 20’s, to surrender himself to the journey and say yes to what comes his way and it took him to insane places. I was actively going for walks just to listen to more of this book because it was so gripping.\n15. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo - @tjenkinsreid\n\nGrace Beverley recommended this to me when I had her on the Deep Dive podcast. It went a bit viral on TikTok so I thought I’d give it a try.\nThe book follows the story of Evelyn Hugo (based off actresses from old Hollywood) who gives her final interview to a journalist as a big tell-all. It was very interesting to explore the film industry, what they had to do to get ahead, the problems women faced etc.\nBonus: The Stormlight Archive Series - @BrandSanderson  \n\nI didn’t read a lot of new fiction this year because I decided to re-read the first three books of this series, and I’m now reading number four. \n\nThey’re super long and I just really enjoyed getting stuck in.\nWhat’s the best book you read last year?",

        "thread": "🧵 Here are six key lessons I learned last year, that I’ll be keeping top of mind in 2023:\n1. Stop pressing the 'try harder' button \n\nWe all fall into the trap of thinking “I’ll just try harder next time” when we fail. \n\nBut it’s better to build a sustainable system for achieving our goals. That way, we won’t repeatedly fail or push yourself to burnout.\ne.g. if you’re a YouTuber and struggling to get your weekly video out on time, don’t just plan to work extra hours in the evening. Consider outsourcing your editing, making shorter videos, or replacing one video per month with a simple vlog.\n\nBuild a system that works for you.\n2. Energisers vs Drainers \n\nNext time you have to choose between two options, ask yourself which one will drain you and which one will energise you. Then choose the option that’ll energise you.\nSome examples might include:\n\nTime with friends &gt; Netflix\n\nEvening gym sesh &gt; morning gym sesh\n\nYour dream work &gt; soulless corporate job that pays twice as much.\n3. Choose to be satisfied \n\nDon’t beat yourself up at the end of the day for not getting enough done. You can actually choose to be satisfied.\n\nYou can even say to yourself, *Well done [insert name here], you wrote 200 words today. Now it’s time to take a break.*\nIt sounds a bit wishy-washy, but it genuinely works. \n\nGive yourself permission to switch off and get enough rest so that you can perform properly the next day.\n4. ‘Planning’ and ‘Doing’ are different modes of being \n\nPlan out what you’re going to do at the start of the day. Then for the rest of the day, simply execute on that plan. \n\nNever try to plan and do at the same time.\nThis is incredibly effective and works on a macro level as well. In 2022, my weeks where I planned everything in advance were much smoother and more productive.\n\nFor more on this topic: https://t.co/t4V70EnbTY\n5. Wake up at the same time everyday\n\nOne of the best hacks for improving your sleep quality (and overall quality of life) is to wake up at the same time every day.\n\nChoose a waking time like 7 or 7:30 that’ll let you get plenty of morning sunlight.\nListening to the @hubermanlab  episode on sleep and talking to circadian rhythm specialist Russell Foster for my Deep Dive podcast made me focus a lot more on sleep last year. \n\nHere's the ep if you missed it: https://t.co/R9odCZx9Cq\n6. The pain of rejection is better than the pain of regret\n\nShoot your shot.\n\nWhether it’s asking someone out, starting a business, moving to a new country… 99% of the time, the pain of failure or rejection is 100 times better than living with ‘what if’ for the rest of your life\nWhat’s one thing you learned last year that’ll change the way you approach this year?\nThese tips came from my Sunday Snippets newsletter.

This thread is sponsored by the @FinancialTimes, I genuinely love their new FT Edit app. I’ll tell you a bit about why below.\n@FinancialTimes 🛌 Get out of bed\n\nI set my alarm for 7.30am every day and charge my iPhone across the room so I’m forced to get up and turn it off. The action of getting out of bed means I’m less likely to snooze.\n@FinancialTimes 😌 Time for calm\n\nI used to get up and get straight to work which left me feeling groggy, so now I take time to slow down and appreciate my mornings a bit more. I’ve been trying out some short 10 minute meditations in the morning to focus and calm my thoughts.\n@FinancialTimes 📖 Learn something new\n\nNow that I’m feeling focused, I like to open the @FinancialTimes FT Edit app and read a few articles. Every weekday 8 articles are selected so you can catch up on the news that matters, without distractions.\n@FinancialTimes I like the fact I have 8 stories to choose from and I always end up learning something new that I wouldn’t have otherwise come across. Makes me feel very cultured.\n\nYou can get a 30-day free trial of the FT Edit here if you’re interested: https://t.co/fPdrFGtg8K\n@FinancialTimes 🚿 Time to get clean\n\nNow it’s time to get ready for the day. I take a shower, brush my teeth, and vitally do my skincare. I learned a lot about skin care this year and the biggest tip I can share is to wear a moisturiser and SPF every day if you want long-term benefits.\n@FinancialTimes My whole skincare routine video is here, if you’re looking to work out yours: https://t.co/fcNEbipV28\n@FinancialTimes ☕ Grab a coffee\n\nMost days I make a tasty cup of coffee using the equipment @jimseven kindly recommended.\n\nThe process of measuring the beans, grinding them, pouring and waiting for the drip gives me a few minutes to think about the day, or catch up on a few more news stories.\n@FinancialTimes @jimseven 📝 Write my morning pages\n\nNow I head to my desk to write morning pages in my bullet journal. It’s basically a stream of consciousness until you feel like you’re done writing. I’ve kept to this consistently and have found it really beneficial to process thoughts and feelings.\n@FinancialTimes @jimseven 💻 Finally, time to get to work\n\nAdding a few things (meditation, reading, journalling) to the morning has increased my focus and happiness levels so that I’m much more productive throughout the day.\n\nIt only takes an extra hour out of the morning, which I think is well worth it.\n@FinancialTimes @jimseven I’ve tried a 5am routine, tried to get to the gym in the morning, told myself to go for a walk first thing, but I never end up sticking to it. \n\nI like getting a lot done in the morning, so these 6 steps are much more achievable and get me in the right mindset.\n@FinancialTimes @jimseven Now over to you. If you were to build your ‘perfect’ morning routine for 2023, what would the steps look like?",

        "thread": "I ranked 1st in my year at Cambridge University.\n\nHere’s a monster thread of 14 study tips to help you smash your exams 👇\n1 - Scope the subject \n\nWhen we’re studying, we don’t always appreciate where a certain fact or branch of the subject fits within the wider scope. One of the first things I always did was map out the full subject on paper so I could have some context of what I was studying. https://t.co/ynrT3c9fSA\nIf you do this at the start of your curriculum, you can easily colour code the areas that you’re good at and highlight what you need to study more.\n\nI used a traffic light🚦 (green, amber, red) system for this in a system like Notion to keep track of where I should spend my time.\n2 - Focus on your weaknesses \n\nIn real life, I’d actually say that this is bad advice, but when you’re taking exams you need to get good grades across the board.\nAt school, there’s no point spending more time focusing on subjects you’re already good at. If you suck at maths but are great at English, you probably should be spending the most time on sums instead of Shakespeare.\n3 - Use a retrospective revision timetable \n\nI think the usual revision timetable where you plan in “next Monday I’m going to study Biology and then Music” is just an exercise in procrastination. I think it's better just to write a to-do list on the day that you're studying.\nMake your list based on what needs the most practice. \n\nOnce you've studied the subject, put the date down next to it (wherever you keep track of these things) and then colour code how well you did today.\n\nHere's a video explaining the process: https://t.co/5J1W96BojF\n4 - Notetaking is a waste of time \n\nOne of students favourite strategies for studying is to summarise from books or lectures, but there’s a lot of research to suggest that this is a really passive way to learn.\nTechniques that feel a bit harder like testing yourself with flashcards will form connections in your brain and help you remember the material better than regurgitating from the book.\n5 - Focus on understanding \n\nYour goal isn’t to memorise the material, it’s actually to understand it. \n\nYou may have heard someone say ‘if you can’t explain it to a 12 year old, you probably don’t understand it’.\nThis is famously the Feynman Technique, where you test if you can explain a topic and then easily answer the ‘but why’ questions that will follow.\n\nAfter a lecture, see if you can explain a topic to a friend or write a short paper on it. This will benefit you massively.\n6 - Do lots of mock exams \n\nExams aren’t really a test of knowledge, they’re a test of exam performance. Unfortunately that’s the way the current education system is designed. So to proverbially ‘play the game’, you need to get good at actively recalling information.\n7 - Use intentional flair\n\nI spent a year supervising medical physiology and read a lot of papers. The best ones usually had great handwriting, added diagrams or started with an engaging introduction. The examiners are reading tons of papers a day, so you want yours to stand out.\n8 - Bank points with coursework \n\nIf your subject has a coursework option, put a good chunk of your time into that. If you get a good grade in coursework, that gives you some leverage (20% or so depending on the course) to your final grade.\n9 - Study with friends \n\nMost people don’t do this because they’re worried about distractions. Yes, you might lose a little bit of productivity but you’ll also 1. be more motivated to turn up and 2. enjoy the act of studying more than you would being in a room alone constantly.\nWhen I was at medical school, I started a pomodoro group with friends. \n\nWe were all studying different things, but we sat together and worked on the same pomodoro timer, and when we’d hit a few hours we’d go for lunch together for a break. It was great vibes.\n10 - Test each other \n\nI did this with my medical student friends. We would each learn one topic really well, and then test others on that subject. So we’d all turn up to a session with different knowledge and learn a lot more than we would of by ourselves.\n11 - Read your friends essays \n\nForm a shared google drive with friends and share all of your essays or revision notes in the drive. If you pool resources, you can benefit a lot from the economy of scale and look at things in a different way to what you might have on your own.\n12 - Have a workspace \n\nIn my first year of medical school I tried learning by myself in my room. But from second year onwards I’d go to the library, grab breakfast and study with friends. I made so much more progress this way and didn’t end up procrastinating in my bedroom.\n13 - Have time to unwind \n\nThere’s an over-glamourisation of over-working these days. When you finish university, you’re not going to remember the amount of sleep you lost to studying. You will remember the fun memories and great friends you made, who will be around for life.\n14 - Enjoy the journey \n\nWhen you’re a student, it can be very easy to defer your happiness until after your exams. \n\nYou’ll never again be in an environment where you’re surrounded by friends who are all doing the same thing, with frankly quite a lot of free time.\nMake sure you’re enjoying every moment of your student life, because the journey is actually so much sweeter than the destination.\nIf you’re itching for more study tips, I have a video where I share how I used flashcards to learn and revise: https://t.co/nbpsHYT0MS\n\nFor more threads like this, follow me here on Twitter @AliAbdaal\nAlso, for context on the slightly clickbait first tweet - I jointly won a prize for best exam performance in my 3rd year out of 6. Technically I guess that means I “ranked first” but it was just in a single year in a single subject hehe. In any case, hope the tips were helpful 😉 https://t.co/v1vVSWLvTr",

        "thread": "These are my top 12 time management tips for students. \n\nI used these when studying medicine at Cambridge University, and I hope they help you too 👇\n1 - Avoid cramming \n\n4 hours of cramming the night before an exam is way less efficient than 4 hours spread out over a few months. We want things to go into our long-term memory to make recalling info easier, not into our short-term memory.\n2 - Learn how to study effectively \n\nI’ve made a ton of videos about this on my YouTube channel because it’s not something you learn at school. Learn about active recall and spaced repetition so you don’t have to spend all of your time studying.\nResources I recommend to learn more about these strategies: \n\n@unjaded_jade’s book “The Only Study Guide You’ll Ever Need”: https://t.co/A0wTc2Ps2e\n\nMy free Skillshare class on studying: https://t.co/XhNLgNS2M4\n3 - Be experimental with self-care\n\nWhen you’re at school, you have tons of opportunities to join a society, a sports team, or learn a new skill. Self-care doesn’t have to mean watching Netflix for two hours every evening - you could expand your horizons by trying a new thing.\n4 - Work out your ideal ordinary week \n\nThis is a tip I’d recommend for anyone at any stage of life. If you could design your week, what would your calendar look like? Compare that to how you’re currently living, and then take steps to make your ideal week a reality.\n5 - Scrap revision timetables \n\nThey’re a complete myth. Unless you’re super conscientious, you’ll spend time planning it out and then won’t actually follow it. I have a video with an alternative way called the ‘retrospective revision timetable’. https://t.co/5J1W96SZbd\n6 - No TV unless it’s a social activity \n\nI love Vampire Diaries as much as the next person, but if you want to watch a series, it’s actually more fun to do it with friends and discuss after. When your pals aren’t free, try spending the time learning a skill or reading instead.\n7 - Nothing good happens after 2AM\n\nI think this is actually from How I Met Your Mother or something (lol). By 2am, you’ve probably already had a good time, had all the DMC’s, and it’s time to go to bed so you don’t feel absolutely dead the next day.\n8 - Run your life religiously based on a calendar \n\nIt boggles my mind when people tell me they don’t run their time using a calendar. Not only does it help you remember things like birthdays and events, but it helps you to be more intentional with your time.\n9 - Schedule absolutely everything \n\nSchedule classes, sports nights, travel time, study time, etc. You’ll be able to see how much you’re doing and it’ll actually get you excited about your week. \n\nWhen you find pockets of 15 mins, try reviewing flashcards instead of scrolling.\nI’m not saying you should never scroll through social media, I do it every day when I’m on the loo. But there’s a difference between spending your time to intentionally relax and spending your time passively scrolling.\n10 - Embrace welcome distractions \n\nWhen I was at university I propped my door open with a doorstop I got for like $5. I think that was probably one of the best investments I made as a student, because it meant people felt welcomed in to have a chat.\nI wanted my friends to interrupt me and stop for a cup of tea. Yes, you’re at uni or college to get a good grade, but you’re also there to make friends and build a network of people who will stay with you through life after school.\n11 - Use downtime for studying \n\nAt medical school, we had an 8 week term time and long 3-6 week holidays, so I got into the habit of using terms to socialise and holidays to knuckle down and study. This worked really well for me to get the most out of the ‘uni experience’.\n12 - Choose to be satisfied\n\nI used to beat myself up when I wasn’t ‘productive enough’, but I realised pretty recently that doing that doesn’t actually change the day or how productive I’ll be the next. All it really does it put you in a low mood, which doesn’t help anyone.\nIf you found this thread helpful, you might like this video that I made 3 years ago that goes into depth about how my friend ranked 1st at medical school. \n\nHave fun with active recall 🥳 https://t.co/4XyblpouH3\nFor more daily tweets of encouragement, follow me @AliAbdaal. \n\nIf you have a time-management tip you think would be helpful to fellow students, drop it below 👇",

        "thread": "How do we build a life that we love? \n\nThis is an evidence-based life design framework that I come back to every few years. \n\nI hope it can help you too 🧵\nStep 1: Identify what matters to you \n\nStep 2: Experiment with ideas\n\nStep 3: Iterate on the good parts\n\nLet's get into the detail 👇\nStep 1: Identify \n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you love the life that you’re living? \n\nTry putting a number to your happiness levels. Now, write down the areas of your life that are contributing to that score, both positive and negative.\nMost people broadly care about these three groups: \n\n💚Health\n💙Work\n❤️Relationships\n\nThere might be other things like spirituality, education, experience, but just for the sake of simplicity, let’s focus on these three as a foundation.\nNow it’s time to work out your next steps...\n\nAsk yourself, what could I be doing in these three areas? For example, what steps can I take towards improving my health? \n\nCould I go for a run before work? Or prep my meals on a Sunday to stop myself eating takeout?\nWriting out this list is all good and well, but make sure to be honest with yourself when you do. Humans have the habit of over-indexing on how productive or motivated our future selves are going to be. \n\nThis is where I use two tests to check I actually want to do ‘the thing’:\nTest One: The Fast-Forward Test ⌛️\n\nImaging you have a button in front of you. If you press it, you can fast forward through any day or any task. Would you do it? \n\nIf the answer is yes, you should probably be focusing your energy elsewhere.\nTest Two: The Odyssey Plan 🎨\n\nThis one is from the book ‘Designing Your Life’. You ask yourself three questions: \n\n1. What does my life look like 5 years from now? \n2. What does my life look like 5 years from now if I take a completely different path?\n3. What does my life look like 5 years from now if money + societal expectations don’t matter?\n\nIf you’ve never done this exercise before, your answers might surprise you.\nThe idea of the odyssey test isn’t to necessarily commit to any of your answers, but to figure out what living a life you love looks like for you.\n\nI did this three years ago and realised my path to becoming an anaesthetist didn’t excite or energise me, so I changed my direction.\nStep Two: Experiment \n\nOk so we have an idea of what matters to us and some of the steps we could take to get there. That’s the plan, now it’s time to take action. \n\nPick one of the bigger goals you wrote down, and decide on the first small step you’re going to make.\nThere are two mistakes we make here: \n\n🗒️Getting caught up in planning all the steps\n🤯Starting more than one experiment at a time\nGive yourself permission to experiment. Trying one new thing at a time is going to be the most effective way to give it your best shot. \n\nI know plenty of people who have started a YouTube channel and decided it isn’t for them, but at least they can tick it off their list.\nStep 3: Iterate \n\nThis is the feedback loop that a lot of us miss out. \n\nWe’ve identified, experimented, and now it's time to improve. A lot of us give up on things before we get to this stage, not giving ourselves the chance to get better.\nThis might be sounding very blue sky, so here’s a example of what it looks like in practice\n\nIdentify: I want to have a Gymshark athlete body\n\nExperiment: I’m going to try a workout plan\n\nIterate: That didn’t work for me, so I’ll hire a personal trainer who understands my goals\nIt’s so easy to overanalyse and consume as much as possible before you get started. It’s totally normal too, it means you care about what you’re doing. \n\nBut trust me, taking a small step towards your goal will feel much better than thinking about it.\nIf this topic resonated with you, this video goes into each of these points in more depth. \n\nMake sure to follow me here @AliAbdaal for daily tweets on how to build a life you love ❤️\n\nhttps://t.co/aHJAs2slfQ",

        "thread": "How do you figure out what you have to offer the world, as an entrepreneur? 🤔\n\nI chatted to @AlexHormozi, the man who has nothing to sell you, about his framework for this:\nStep 1⃣ - realise that everybody knows something well enough to share it \n\nThat’s just a fact of living; your eyes and ears have taken in things that will be somewhat different to the people around you.\nThere are three key ‘buckets’ that inform your experience: \n\n1 - Your parents jobs and hobbies \n\n2 - Your past jobs \n\n3 - Your current interests\nYCombinator, one of the most successful start-up investors in Silicon Valley, has a specific set of criteria for companies they invest in. \n\nBut one of the most important is some kind of past experience.\nIn our interview, Alex said that’s because there’s so much ignorance debt that the investor will have to make up for if you don’t have a good understanding of the industry.\nIf your parent was a car mechanic for example, chances are you’re going to have a pretty good understanding of the problems someone in that area could face.\nPeople often think they need to have a crazy new explosive idea to start a business, but really you just need to pick one problem and solve it better than other people on the market.\nBasically we should view our upbringing, past jobs, and current interests as opportunities to learn and find problems to solve. \n\nOn the path to find your niche, you’ll come across 5-10 different business ideas that’ll catch your interest.\nThis is super valuable to remember, I think, because it encourages you to enjoy the journey you’re on and look for new opportunities in everything you do.\nFrom building my team, I’ve found that the employee mindset is often ‘this is my task’ rather than an entrepreneurial mindset of ‘this is a problem I can solve’. \n\nIt's a really straightforward mindset shift to make if you can identify you're doing it.\nStep 2⃣ - decide on which of those things, from the three buckets, you feel like you could help someone do better. Then package it in the simplest way possible. \n\nIt’s as easy as simplifying it down to ‘I have experience playing guitar, there are tons of people who want to learn'\nIf you’ve just started out, remember that the internet doesn’t do well with nuance. \n\nAlex says when he first started on his entrepreneurial journey, he found the more explicit he was about his goals, the more people trusted what he had to say.\nSo, at the age of 23, Alex realised he had enough of an interest in fitness where other people were asking him to help them with programmes and stuff. So, he tried his hand at training them.\nHe asked his first 12 clients to donate money to charity in exchange to work with him, with the deal that he’d collect testimonials from them for future clients. He was setting himself up to do it all 'for real' in the future.\nSounds like a super simple start, right? All Alex did was make it low friction to start, and learned and changed his approach on the job.\n\n“If you try to think 100 steps into the future when you have no context, there’s no point. Chaos will break your plan.”\nIt's important to remember that around 90% of new businesses fail. We shouldn't get too attached to one idea - it's much more productive to be able to move onto the next with lessons from each attempt.\nWe cover this in more detail in the full podcast episode, as well as Alex’s advice on business growth, content creation and consistency 🚀\n\nListen here: https://t.co/uExwXIXxl6",

        "thread": "I spoke to work happiness consultant Samantha Clarke (@samanthaand_) about how we can all find fulfilling careers. \n\nHere are three key questions she asks her clients, try answering them yourself 👇\n1) ‘Where did I first hear this thought?’👂\n\nAll of us have limiting beliefs that stop us for going for what we want. Samantha says we need to unpack exactly where these negative thoughts come from, so we can learn exactly why we have certain internal barriers.\n2) ‘Should I monetise my hobbies?’💸\n\nWe all have passions - mine are singing and playing the guitar. But is this something I could realistically make a career from? And should I? Probably not. If we turn our hobbies into jobs, we risk losing the joy we find in them.\n3) ‘How might success change me?’🚵🏼\n\nWe can actually be scared of being successful, not just of failure. Picture yourself successful in your field. Are you scared of people perceiving you differently? Are you worried you’ll change? Or be stuck in a niche?\nBy talking to our ‘inner critic’, Samantha says that we can turn it into a muse - a source of encouragement and inspiration. Or, we can find out our goals aren’t actually what we thought they were.\nDoing quick journalling exercises like this put us better position to work out exactly what we want, and how to achieve it.\nSamantha is such a wealth of knowledge and insight, so if you need to confront your inner critic (or just want to learn more about happiness at work) then listen to my full podcast ep with her here: https://t.co/yLg9F9rjM2",

        "thread": "These are the 5 financial mistakes I made as a teenager 💸🧵\n1. Being late to the investment game \n\nCompounding isn’t the reason I wish I’d started earlier, I actually just wish I got into the habit earlier to understand how it works. \n\nIt took me 2-3 years to feel comfortable with investing and understand where to start when I was 19. https://t.co/BmZfvXWvBw\n2. Spending money on low value things \n\nI’d love to go back and tell my teenage self to run potential purchases through a bit of a thought process to make sure I was buying them for a good reason. \n\nHere’s how I think about it now:\n🧑‍⚖️The law of diminishing returns \n\nWhen I review tech, I often have people ask me whether they should buy the newest version of the iPad or Apple watch. My answer is usually that it’s not worth it, and that you can get the cheaper version and it’ll give you just as much value.\n🤔Is there anything else I’d rather spend my money on? \n\nAka is there anything I should buy first that would have a bigger impact? If people are looking for a purchase that will actually change their life, I’d say a Kindle is 100% worth it long-term.\n🛍️Do I really want this thing, or is it because others have it? \n\nA lot of purchases are really just virtue signals to other people. For example, upgrading your Apple watch or phone whenever a new one comes out. If you don’t need it, you could be spending that money more wisely.\n3. Getting stuck in the cheapskate mindset\n\nOn the other hand, we don’t want to get to a place where we don’t spend money on things that help us in the long run, like a laptop, books, a course to learn to code or edit.\nAs you get older, you have a higher earning potential, but the happiness you get from spending declines. \n\nWhen you’re a teen, I would actually advise you to spend rather than save, because $20 can go a long way to helping you learn and develop at that age. https://t.co/EyklhomW9z\n4. Buying things from unreliable sources \n\nWhen I was 18, I decided to buy a Macbook Air, my first step into becoming an ‘Apple Fanboy’. But because I was trying to find the cheapest deal possible, I ended up getting scammed out of around $1,000 and a laptop that didn't work.\nIf you’re buying something second hand, be really wary of what you’re getting and maybe a friend or family member to check it for you. Take your time to make sure you don’t get scammed.\n5. Misjudging the value of my time \n\nMaking money when you’re young feels exciting and new. When I was 14, I did my first web design project for £300, but didn’t work out that I’d really understated how much time it would take and really made a loss.\nI learned two lessons from this: \n\n1️⃣ Distinguish between relative income and absolute income. Absolute income is just the $ value. But relative takes into account the price and time involved. \n\n2️⃣ Set an aspirational hourly rate, even when you’re young and inexperienced\nFor more daily advice like this, follow me @AliAbdaal :)\n\nWhat financial advice would you give to your younger self?

        "thread": "If you're struggling to focus, you might want to work on improving your brain health🧠\n\nNeuroscientist Dr @TaraSwart shared her three-step process to increasing neuroplasticity in our recent Deep Dive interview👇🏽\nLevel 1 - The Basics \n\nIt’s important to begin with the foundations. Tara says you should start by eating healthy and drinking lots of water before even thinking about adding anything new to your routine. \n\nIt sounds straightforward but it'll do you wonders.\nYou get more health benefits from 'dark skinned' foods like aubergine (eggplant), blueberries, black beans, dark choc and good quality coffee.\n\nThat's because the skin in darker foods has the antioxidant anthocyanin which helps with neurogenesis (growing new neurons)\nLevel 2 - Build Habits\n\nOnce you’re in the swing, you can add in things like:\n\n🧠Consistently getting 8 hours sleep\n🧠Daily activity (going for a walk, to the gym, for a swim)\n🧠Starting a meditation or journaling practice to clear your mind\n🧠Practicing listening &amp; being present\nAerobic exercise is better for your brain i.e. walking, running, swimming, cycling\n\nConsistent exercise like this produces 13-14% cell turnover\nLevel 3 - Try Something New\n\nLike intermittent fasting, if it suits your lifestyle. \n\nIntermittent fasting causes metabolic switching, which increases neuroplasticity. This is a good thing because it optimises your brain function and builds resistance to injury or illness.\nBonus tip: repetition leads to stronger willpower, but also to stronger pathways being created in your brain (aka myelination) \n\nYour willpower reduces over the day, so if you're struggling to build a new habit or work on something, try doing it first thing instead\nI highly recommend listening to the full episode - it's super in-depth and fascinating if you want to understand how our brains really work 🎙️\n\nListen on Spotify: https://t.co/vTDN1V5Cuu\n\nOr Apple podcasts: https://t.co/aewDZck7Tt",

        "thread": "One of the best productivity “hacks” that I’ve ever come across: \n\nThe concept of overcoming activation energy 👇\nActivation energy is the spark required to start anything new. \n\nWe’ll often put off starting things in favour of planning and thinking. Now this isn’t necessarily a bad thing - it’s of course good to think things through - but it can hold us back.\nTake a moment to think of a project, piece of homework or decision that felt like a huge hurdle to jump over, but once you started you realised it was easy to keep going, and you wondered why you hadn't started sooner.\nTo overcome the ‘activation energy’ that holds us back, we need to push past the start line. \n\nTell yourself you’ll spend just five minutes on the first task, and then you can stop. \n\nObviously, after the first five minutes you’ll probably want to keep going.

Hell Yeah or No - Derek Sivers @sivers \n\nWhen we’re young and we don’t have many opportunities, we should probably say yes to most things. But when we’ve gained more experience, we should play by the hell yeah or no principle. If it’s not a hell yeah, it has to be a no.\n2. Someday is Today - @MatthewDicks \n\nThis book encourages you to stop dreaming about what you want and start making steps towards it. Matthew says you need to be willing to make terrible things, because taking away that expectation actually gets you started on the right path.\n3. The 4 Hour Work Week - @tferriss \n\nIf you’ve been around for a while, you’ll know this book absolutely changed my life. I have a whole video on it here - but in short Tim will totally change the way you think about your goals for work and retirement. \n\nhttps://t.co/ELh5r1mV9J\n4. Entrepreneur Revolution - @DanielPriestley \n\nDaniel takes us through the ways to adapt our lifestyles to think, network and build like an entrepreneur. We live in a world where agile, small business owners can make a big impact and this book will get you very motivated.\n5. The Third Door - @AlexBanayan\n\nAlex didn’t know what to do with his life, so he set out to get advice from entrepreneurs he admired like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, and this is a compilation of the advice, stories and tools he learned along the way. \n\nhttps://t.co/7opQW5z2Qi\nThose are my five favourites, but if you feel like I’ve missed a must-read book, drop it as a reply.

        "thread": "We need to change the way we think about retirement. \n\nWhen you picture yourself retired, you might think of you at 65-70 years old, with hopefully enough savings in the bank to enjoy yourself. \n\nBut we’re kind of missing the point 🧵\nRetirement is a pretty modern concept. \n\nIt was introduced in 1889 by a German Chancellor who saw there was a problem with getting young people into work. He worked out that if the government paid 60+ year olds to leave work, it would be good incentive for lifelong security.\nThis was all good when the life expectancy was lower and people worked for the same company for many years. But it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. \n\nThere's a movement of people online who are looking for ways to retire early, and I say there's loosely three types:\nFirst off, there’s a movement online known as F.I.R.E. (Financial Independence Retire Early). Bit of a strange acronym but you get the picture \n\nThere are two types of F.I.R.E. - FAT and LEAN 👇🏽\nFAT F.I.R.E. - people who have made a healthy amount of money and invested it into stocks and shares, safely withdraw 4% of the money in their investment account every year to live on.\nThis is an ok option, but if you want say $40k a year to live on, you’d need $1 million in your investment portfolio to keep that going. It’s not going to work for everyone.\nThen there’s LEAN F.I.R.E. - drive down your costs as much as possible so that you don’t need as much in your savings to make retirement possible.\n\nAgain, this won’t be doable for everyone, especially people with families and responsibilities outside of taking care of themselves.\nBoth of these concepts look at how to get to the point of quitting your job entirely. But I think we can find a more realistic middle ground - retirement type 3. \n\nIt’s going to sound cliche, but bare with me.\nIn your day-to-day, you trade your time for money. It’s a concept talked about in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, many of us end up working for someone else, taking our pay-check at the end of each month, and budgeting that money across our wants and needs until retirement. https://t.co/d17iSVj1WU\nBut what if the ultimate goal wasn’t retirement? What if, instead, the goal was to enjoy now, then, and all the in-between moments?\nLet’s run this thought experiment. \n\nIf you won the lottery and were sorted for money for life, what work would you be doing?\n\nYour answer might be sitting on a beach somewhere with a cocktail, but realistically this would get pretty boring and you’d start to twiddle your thumbs.\nWhen I run this thought experiment, I think I’d be pretty happy with anything that’s along the lines of reading, writing, learning and teaching. Once you work that out, you can start making changes that make that a reality now, not later.\nLooking at my calendar, I can work out which things are helping me reach that goal and which are draining my energy, and shift them to suit the life I want to lead.\nNow, this thought experiment could result in something drastic like quitting your job and starting in a new field. But it could also be as simple as saying no to things that don’t fit your vision, or saying yes to more things that do.\nWhen you reframe it this way, you realise that you don’t really want money in order to retire. You want the money so you can enjoy your life at all ages. \n\n@naval ravikant said:\n“When today is complete in itself, you are retired.”\nIt’s not a straightforward, one-size-fits-all solution, but a way of thinking about how you earn your money and how much enjoyment you want to get out of life along the way. \n\nFor a lengthier explanation on this topic: https://t.co/h0tM3PR06m\np.s. this isn’t financial advice, just a summary of information widely available on the internet 🙂\nFor 7 side hustle ideas you can start today to make money on the internet: https://t.co/ih66yOKJIe\n\nAnd for more tweets like these that help you build a life you love, follow me @AliAbdaal 🙂",

It's impossible to be completely original, so don't put that pressure on yourself otherwise you'll never create anything\n2. \"My work has to help people\" 💔\n\nIf you're trying to help absolutely everyone, you're going to run into a lot of barriers. \n\nWhen you sit down to write, create - whatever it is - think about one person you could help + draw out value for them, then the ideas will start to flow\n3. \"It's not good enough to show anyone\" 😰\n\nDon't waste time thinking about how 'worthy' your work is.

If you help people solve a problem, they’re going to be more likely to like, subscribe and invest time in you.\nThe simplest way of defining this is asking these three questions: \n\n1️⃣ What’s the value that I want my viewers to get from my channel? \n\n2️⃣ Why should they care about my videos? \n\n3️⃣ What about my channel will keep them coming back?\nThis whole exercise is great for beginners who haven’t started yet, but equally as useful if you’ve been making videos for a little while and need some refreshed motivation.\nUse this as place to start, but don’t get hung up on it or niche stop you from making a video. You should be more focused on creativity than anything else in your early days 🚀\n\nIf this thread helped, follow me @AliAbdaal for daily tweets that'll help you build a life you love :)",

        "thread": "I’ve been in the YouTube game for a while now (5 years) so I thought I’d ask some of our Part-Time YouTuber Academy alumni what their advice would be for beginner creators.\n\nHere’s what they said 👇\n“Just do! Get started, put something out, even if you upload it as unlisted to get into the rhythm. Remember that you’re not being paid at the beginning so the process should be fun and creative, and you’ll get better over time.”\n\n@GeorgiaDoust (1.56k sub, Cohort 5)\n“Make content like nobody is watching you. Do what feels right to you, ignore the self doubt, and make the video. You’ll probably feel weird, but no-one is watching you at the beginning anyway so you might as well try.”\n\n@itanio (Toscoe, 600+ subs, Cohort 5 and 6)\nHave fun - don’t think about anything complicated, don’t look at analytics, it doesn’t matter right now. What really matters is making good videos you’re proud of - so put the blinders on and enjoy making a video each week!”\n\n Beccy Lee, @confuciusme (121 subs, Cohort 2)\n“Be kind to yourself - as you meet other creators and go on your own journey, you’ll realise it’s normal to change your niche, have one video perform better than another, and you have to become comfortable with the up’s and down’s creatively.\n\n@thejoyceling (70 subs, Cohort 5)\n“Make the upload button your best friend. You need to make it less of a thing in your mind. The easier it is for you to make a video and upload, the more you’ll enjoy it and the the better you’ll get each time.”\n\n@mo_t_ivate (3.28k subs, Cohort 1)\n“There were so many times when I was stuck in my head about my channel direction, but nothing changed until I actually got started. Actually making videos and throwing ideas out there helps you to figure things out and build confidence.”\n\nZoe Rivers (161 subs, Cohort 6)\nIt’s interesting that the most common advice is just to get started. \n\nI like to say ‘throw spaghetti at the wall’ because that’s the only way you’ll know if you like making the content. If you scroll down to the beginning of my channel for example, I made music videos 😜 https://t.co/vgRvv2Oap5\nIf you want to learn how to make better videos + connect with other creators (like the cool people who helped me write this thread), you can grab a spot on the next cohort of PTYA now. \n\nPlaces are open until end of day, Monday 7th: https://t.co/UB559C5zXE",

        "thread": "Last night I did a 1.5 hour live stream about how to grow on YouTube, taking questions from people who’ve signed up to our Part-Time YouTuber Academy waiting list for the next cohort.\n\nHere are some of the Q+A's that came out of that, in case anyone's interested 😜 https://t.co/fTJM9Gp9Fv\nQ1: What should you care about at each level of YouTube growth?\n\nA: I started off the stream by sharing my “Get Going, Get Good, Get Smart” model (linked below). Until you’re at Level 3 (around 1k subscribers+) you shouldn’t get bogged down by analytics. \nhttps://t.co/tEIA2P1DOJ https://t.co/m1w5ns8LJt\nThis sounds counterintuitive but trust me - if you focus on analytics too much early on, it’ll suck the fun out of it and you won’t be as creative. \n\nIn your “Get Good” phase, you want to throw as much spaghetti at the wall as you can and find out what sticks 🍝\nQ2: My most watched video isn’t in my niche - should I continue down that path?\n\nA: Just because something isn't what you originally had planned, doesn't mean you can't explore and see how it goes. As long as the video isn't targeting a wildly different audience, it'll do no harm https://t.co/Cwbp412eL3\nIf you settle on a completely different niche later, you can always private or unlist the video. It's not as deep as we often think it is, so go for it 🚀\nQ3: Shortform is such a big thing right now - can you grow your channel with just shorts? What’s the balance?\n\nA: We’re kind of in this golden phase right now where YouTube is prioritising creator’s who make a mix of content to meet consumers where they’re at. https://t.co/6klFgSVeS2\nThe current algorithm means people who see and engage with your shorts are more likely to be recommended your long-form content. You probably don’t want to build a channel from just YouTube shorts as the ‘relationship’ you build through longform content can’t be matched.\nSo, if you have the capacity for it, one long-form and two-short form a week would be a good place to start and experiment 💡\nIf you find this kinda thing useful, enrolment for Cohort 7 of my Part-Time YouTuber Academy opens tomorrow at 4pm GMT. \n\nSpaces are capped at 400, so make sure you're signed up to be notified when we open doors: https://t.co/Fw2Gkt0k9t",

        "thread": "In 5 years of YouTube, the most common question I still get from my viewers is “how are you so productive?”\n\nSo here’s a thread of 15 actionable tips that help me do more of the things that matter to me, without burning out. 🧵\n1 - Set a Daily Highlight. Each morning, ask yourself “what’s the most important thing I want to do today?” and then make sure you just do that thing. When you do this everyday (or even most days) for a whole year, you make an incredible amount of progress.\n2 - Have an Hourglass on your Desk - This is a simple reminder to make the most of your time. I use a sand timer, but you could also use an hourglass app on your phone or computer.\n3 - Set a “No-Internet” Day Once a Week - This has been a game-changer for me. On Wednesdays, I don’t allow myself to go on the Internet until 5pm. This means no social media, no email, no news, no nothing.\n4 - Make a “To-Don’t” List - This is a list of things that you shouldn’t do, no matter what. For me, this list includes things like checking my email first thing in the morning, working on the weekends, and checking social media frequently throughout the day.\n5 - The Pomodoro Technique - This is a time management technique that involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5 minute break. I’ve found that this helps me stay focused and avoid burnout.\n6 - Batch Similar Tasks Together - This means doing all of your similar tasks at the same time. For example, I like to batch all of my writing tasks together. So, if I have to write a blog post, record a video, and write an email, I’ll do all of those things one after the other.\n7 - Get in a Flow State - This is when you’re so focused on a task that you lose track of time. When you’re in a flow state, you’re usually in “the zone” and you’re extremely productive.\n8 - Take Breaks Regularly - It’s important to take breaks throughout the day, even if you’re in a flow state. I like to take a 5-10 minute break every hour or so. During my break, I’ll usually walk around, get a drink of water, or do something else to relax.\n9 - Have a Set Schedule - I’ve found that it’s helpful to have a set schedule for my day. I know that I’ll work from 9am-5pm Monday through Friday and I know that I’ll take a break at 12pm for lunch. Having a set schedule helps me stay on track and avoid getting sidetracked.\n10 - Get Rid of Distractions - This is a big one. If you want to be productive, you need to get rid of anything that’s going to distract you. For me, this means putting my phone on silent, turning off all notifications, and working in a quiet environment.\n11 - Set Goals - Having goals is important because it gives you something to strive for. I like to set both long-term and short-term goals. For example, my long-term goal might be to write a book and my short-term goal might be to write 1000 words per day.\n12 - Use a Task Manager - I use a task manager to keep track of all of the things I need to do. This helps me stay organized and make sure that I’m doing the most important tasks. I use the app Todoist, but there are a ton of other great options out there.\n13 - Follow the 80/20 Rule - The 80/20 rule is the principle that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. This means that you should focus on the things that are giving you the most results.\n14 - Delegate and Outsource - Delegate and outsource the things that you don’t need to do yourself. For example, I outsource my bookkeeping / accounting. This frees up my time so that I can focus on the things that I’m good at and that I enjoy.\n15 - Take Time for Yourself - This is probably the most important tip of all. You can’t be productive if you’re not taking care of yourself. Take time for things like exercise, relaxation, and hobbies. This will help you avoid burnout and will make you more productive 😀",

But if you’re looking to do YouTube part-time then the closest thing to a magic bullet is a system.\n\nIt will allow you to grow your channel sustainably and to plug in other people when the time comes to have a team.\nSystems are basically a set of processes that take us to our desired result.\n\nIn the words of @JamesClear: “Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.”\nLet’s assume that our goal is to get 100,000 subscribers.\n@JamesClear To reach 100,000 subscribers on YouTube you’ll need to:\n\n-Have a big list of video ideas\n-Write scripts that provide value for every video\n-Post at least one video a week for a year\n\nFor tips on how to write scripts check this: https://t.co/UUUzZXaOZ8\n@JamesClear Consistency is the hardest part about a YouTube channel.\n\nBanking on motivation or willpower to grow your channel won’t cut it.\n\nThat’s why you should be trying to piece together repeatable processes that can become streamlined and/or automated over time.\n@JamesClear Without a system, you’ll be reinventing the wheel every time you film a new video.\n\nThis makes improving your videos that little bit more difficult, as there’s nothing standardised to build on top of as your foundation.\n@JamesClear In PTYA I share exactly how I grew my channel from 0 to 3 million subscribers while doing YouTube only part-time.\n\nBut the system doesn’t only help you grow your subscribers count.\nIt also takes care of major challenges that a YouTuber has to face like👇\n@JamesClear 🤝 Building a team\n🎥 Dealing with cameras, mics, and lighting\n💡 Running out of ideas\n🏗 Structuring your videos...\n💰 Monetising your channel\n♻️ Repurposing your content\n📨 Outsourcing content production\n\nTo mention only a few.\nhttps://t.co/mdkzMfGJTo\n@JamesClear If you found this thread helpful, you might want to sign-up to the PTYA waitlist: https://t.co/1GsWgWryGx\n\nMake sure to follow me @AliAbdaal for daily tweets about productivity, health, wealth, love, happiness and impact 🙂",

        "thread": "We all want to get the best night's sleep possible. \n\nI recently spoke with world expert Prof. Russel Foster to get his advice. Here's a mega thread of his top tips - scroll for sleep 🧵\n1) It starts in the morning 🌞\n\nExposure to light in the morning sets our body clocks properly. Taking a walk first thing will give your body the light it needs to tell the time and start your day right.\n2) Take 20 minute naps 😴\n\nThe occasional afternoon nap can be really beneficial. As long as you don’t sleep for more than 20 minutes, you'll wake up more alert and with more energy for the rest of your day. Try it next time you're procrastinating 😜\n3) Exercise often 💪\n\nIt really is true, exercise works wonders. But be careful - if you work out too close to bed you’ll raise your core temperature which will make it harder to fall asleep.\n4) Find your food schedule🥘\n\nIf you can, having bigger meals in the morning or the middle of the day means that you won’t get a spike in glucose before bed.\n5) Avoid too much caffeine ☕\n\nSorry to say, caffeine sticks around for a while after you have it. It has a half-life of 5-9 hours, so having one late in the afternoon can make it harder to snooze. Try cutting caffeine earlier in the afternoon to see if it helps.\n6) Switch modes after work 🔇\n\nGo to the gym, do something creative, read, hang out with friends. Stimulate your mind so that you feel ready to sleep when it gets to bedtime.\n7) Stop using devices 📱\n\nNot necessarily for the light, there’s a misconception here. Scrolling on social media or watching videos before bed keeps our brains active, so we're not allowing ourselves to switch off.\n8) Avoid sleeping pills 💊\n\nSleeping pills are receptor depressants, but they are not a substitute for real sleep. Unless prescribed, avoid them if you can and try changing your pre-sleep habits.\n9) Avoid alcohol too🍻\n\nLots of people get stuck in a cycle of drinking lots of coffee to stay awake, and then lots of alcohol to relax. This can badly disrupt our sleep and disrupt our memory.\n10) No tough talk before bed 🤐\n\nProf. Russel says that we should avoid talking about stressful topics like family finances before bed, because this can really impact our ability to get a good night’s sleep. If somethings on your mind, try journaling to clear your thoughts.\n11) Temperature 🌡️\n\nTry and keep your room cool. If we’re too hot then our body can’t shut down properly and we won't get the best sleep. Crack open the window a bit before bed to cool things down.\n12) Keep it quiet 🤫\n\nThis can be tricky, especially of you live in a city, but try and keep noise to a minimum. Try out white noise of relaxing sounds - whatever works for you.\n13) Set the tone 🌌\n\nBright lights will keep our brains active. I use blackout blinds and they are totally worth it, especially so you don't wake up too early the next day.\n14) Remove your computer 💻\n\nPhysically remove computers and TVs from your bedroom so it’s hard for you to turn them on. This can be difficult if you’re working from home but try your best to build distance between you and your laptop (and phone!)\n15) Keep to a routine 📆\n\nYou don't have to be religious about it, but keeping to a rough sleep schedule will help you build a better body clock. Aiming to get ready to sleep around the same time every day is a good place to start.\n16) Buy a mechanical clock ⏰\n\nDon’t use your phone as an alarm because it encourages bad sleep habits. Get a mechanical alarm clock and cover the numbers if you have to so that they don’t distract you.\n17) It’s okay to sleep alone 👫\n\nIf you sleep next to a partner, you might find that you don’t sleep as well. It is completely okay not to sleep next to your partner all the time if it improves the quality of your sleep.\n18) Watch out for sleep apnoea ‼️\n\nThis is a condition where someone stops breathing while they sleep. If you notice this in yourself or your partner, you should speak to a doctor. It can be serious but is easily treatable.\n19) Stay calm 🧘\n\nIf you wake up in the middle of the night, don’t panic. You will be able to go back to sleep - just spend sometime in another environment, avoid the clock, drink some water, and go back to bed when you're ready.\nWe tend to think of sleep as something which happens to us - not something we can control. But the truth is we can have a big impact on the quality of our sleep. \n\nFor more insight into how our body clocks work, check out my convo with Prof Russel here: https://t.co/XthvYTpzzf\nOr, if you like to listen to your podcasts: https://t.co/JMVuzWkFQ0\n\nAnd if you found this thread useful, follow me for more tips.

This could be sharing a tweet or putting up a quick Instagram Story. \n\nIf you don’t have an audience, ask friends and family what they’d like to know about the subject you're interested to talk about.\nB → The Birdsong Technique\n\nWhen you're a content consumer, you passively enjoy the things that other people have created. \n\nWhen you become a creator, you’ll realise that ideas are everywhere. Your Twitter feed is no longer a wave of text - it’s thoughts, concepts and lessons.\nYou should keep up to date with both like-minded and different YouTubers in the mindset of a creator - once we begin to appreciate filmmaking, we tune in and find inspiration. Steal like an Artist and all that.\nKeep a slip file of things that spark your interest or that you'd like to learn how to recreate, and revisit this when you're researching and scripting for a video. \n\nThe same thing can apply to writers, podcasters, any creative medium.\nC → Coal Mining\n\nA coal mine is an area where you're likely to find coal (i.e. video ideas) if you start digging.\n\nThis coal can then be used to create diamonds (i.e. banging video content).\nCoal mines could be Twitter lists, Reddit threads, Instagram pages, newsletters and even other YouTube channels.\n\nWhenever you find one of these mines, make a note of the link and refer back to it whenever you’re feeling short of ideas.\nCoal mining isn’t about plagiarising or copying content, it’s about taking inspiration to create your own stuff.\n\nIn the words of one of my favourite authors @austinkleon: “nothing is original”. \n\nI’d recommend reading Steal Like An Artist for more about this topic. https://t.co/Hzp5t279Oe\nThe ABC method is only as good as the system behind it.\n\nIf you don't have a system to properly store/capture your ideas you're only going to forget them: https://t.co/TLiU4ilrC9\nWithout enough ideas for YouTube videos, you’ll stop publishing consistently.\n\nIf you found this thread helpful, why not learn the other frameworks I teach to budding creators in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nJoin the waiting list for the next cohort https://t.co/zCUGapzFG9",

The Tim Ferriss Show\n\n@tferris interviews successful people like Hugh Jackman or Neil Gaiman about their tactics, tools, and routines. This has put some ridiculously interesting people on my radar, like @sivers and @mrmoneymustache.\n2. Deviate with Rolf Potts\n\n@rolfpotts chats with explorers, travel writers and researchers about their adventures. Great for escapism, and always makes me feel like going hiking in the Andes or something.\n3. Bookworm\n\nA bit of a hidden treasure. These two guys (Joe and Mike) read and discuss a new book every two weeks. I’ve found loads of great stuff that I would have missed otherwise, like Make Time by John Zeratsky (@jazer).\n4. Not Overthinking\n\nI co-host Not Overthinking with my brother @taimurabdaal. We have an excuse to hang out, chat, and get into some deep topics and in 10 years’ time, we’ll be able to look back and see exactly what our stupid younger selves were thinking.\n5. Diary of a CEO\n\n@StevenBartlettSC interviews business leaders, celebrities, and authors, to find out what makes them tick. Steven’s great at getting guests to open up, so there are lots of direct and honest conversations.\n6. @hubermanlab \n\nThis is the only health podcast I listen to. Andrew Huberman's a professor at the Stanford School of Medicine. He examines the science around a topic like dopamine, sleep, or skincare for every episode, and gives actionable advice on tweaking your lifestyle.\n7. My First Million\n\nStarted off as @shaanVP and @thesamparr asking business founders how they made their first million dollars. \n\nNow, it’s mostly Sam and Shaan analysing other creators and founders who’ve done well, and riffing on new business ideas.\n8. The Knowledge Project\n\nInterviews hosted by @ShaneAParrish from Farnam Street. Tagline: \"mastering the best of what other people have already figured out\"\n\nStart with the @naval episode, it blew my mind 🤯\n9. Indie Hackers\n\nInterviews with \"indie hackers’ – entrepreneurs who’ve started online businesses from their bedrooms making 1k, 10k, 100k, or even a 1M dollars a month. If my business died, I'd probably binge Indie Hackers, then go code a software product.\n10. Noah Kagan Presents\n\n@noahkagan’s a marketing expert who interviews CEOs, consultants + investors about success.

What’s your goal + why? \nI'd suggest 1 video a week. It's important to affirm what content you want to make and why at the beginning, to motivate yourself. \n\n2. What tasks will help you get there? \ni.e. research, scripting, filming, editing\n3. When will you get started? \nset a date and calendar block those individual tasks. be realistic but firm with yourself\n\n4. Start habit stacking = filming multiple videos on one day, or scripting in your lunch break, for example\n\n5. Stay consistent + results will follow 🙂\nAll it takes to form a habit is a quick calendar shuffle and commitment to do the things. \n\nIt's like @JamesClear says “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”\nIf you're thinking of jumping in and taking YouTube seriously, our next cohort of the Part-Time YouTuber Academy is coming up. \n\nSign up to the waiting list to hear more about it 🚀 https://t.co/yXYsz0qnTO",

Big L.\nBut this kind of thing happens more than you’d think. \n\nThere are so many variables to filming - there could be background noise we didn’t notice like an air con unit, or we lose a vital cable and have to hunt around when we need to set up a second shot.\nIt's not just me who has this kind of issue.\n\nCreators of all sizes have to set up their gear, check the audio, the lighting, the framing, etc before sitting down to film.\n\nYes, it gets easier with a team and better equipment, but there's always room for improvement.\nEven @SteveBartlettSC, who hosts the biggest podcast in the UK, has to stop recording when an ambulance comes past his house, mid-conversation.\n\nThat blew my mind. I just assumed a production that big would have a sound-proof studio, but it's a studio set-up in his living room.\nSo I hope this gives support and encouragement to any up and coming creators out there.\n\nFilming issues are just part of the game. You can try to mitigate them as much as possible, but they're inevitable.\n\nYou'd be amazed at how much is fixed in the edit lol 😜\nIf you're interested in reading more \"behind the scenes\" content like this, you can check out the Creatorpreneur newsletter or follow me here @aliabdaal :)\n\nhttps://t.co/xkHyfctNil",

I re-record things if I'm not feeling the end result.\n\nHere are 5 things that'll help you come across better on camera 📸\n1. Scripted vs unscripted\n\nTake the time to bullet point (or word-for-word script, down to personal preference) your video structure before you press record. \n\nHaving an idea of what you're going to say will help you relax into the video.\n2. Natural eye contact\n\nIf you don't look at the camera enough, or you stare at it way too much, it can look really strange lol\n\nThe trick is to look at the lens slightly more than you'd look into someone's eyes in real life to keep the viewers attention.\n3. Don't go overboard with hand gestures\n\nI imagine a box in front of me, 1-2 feet tall and 1-2 feet wide.\n\nThis is where my hands and arms can and should operate, and will generally never get too distracting for the viewer.\n4. Talk through slip-ups\n\nIt's really easy to stop and start when you mess up your words. I find continuing through the mistake can help you relax and be a bit more human on camera.\n\nIt's easy to think you need to be perfect, but your viewers will relate more to imperfection.\n5. Speak with a (natural) smile\n\nIt's ridiculous how much more engaging you are when you look like you're enjoying yourself. \n\nResearch supports that when you smile at someone, they feel better and more connected. It'll probably make you feel more relaxed, too.\nIf you liked this thread, you might like to sign up to my 5 day camera confidence email crash course.

        "thread": "Here are ten invaluable writing tips from the master himself, @MatthewDicks. Scroll for storytelling 📖\n@MatthewDicks 1. Homework for life\n\nMy favourite tip from Matthew; pick one moment from every day to write down, and soon you’ll begin to find trends and stories you can write about. I love doing this and looking back at the end of each month to see what I picked out.\n@MatthewDicks 2. Clarity is your goal\n\nThe best stories aren’t the most elaborate, inventive, or spectacular. They are small moments - told with absolute clarity.\n@MatthewDicks 3. No stand up comedy\n\nThere’s no harm in making people laugh when you tell a story, but it’s important to remember that story-telling is not as funny as stand up. They are different skills and translate differently on the page.\n@MatthewDicks 4. Change is relatable\n\nStories are compelling because they show change over time. We love reflection, transformation, character growth. Without these things, you have an anecdote, not a story.\n@MatthewDicks 5. The harsh truth about vacation stories\n\nNo one wants to hear about your vacation 🙃\n@MatthewDicks 6. Even if you’re struggling, write it down\n\nStaring at a blank page can be really intimidating. When I have an idea, I start writing without putting pressure on myself. Getting words down on a page begin to give your idea structure and makes it feel more manageable.\n@MatthewDicks 8. Five magical seconds\n\nMatthew says “Don’t get hung up on the big moments, the unbelievable circumstances, or the hilarious details. Seek out the moments when you felt your heart move…\n\nUntil you have it, you don’t have a story.”\n@MatthewDicks 9. Bridge the gap\n\nStorytelling is all about connecting with your audience. Excitement isn’t actually very important - instead, we want to create a space of vulnerability and honesty with another person.\n@MatthewDicks 10. End with heart\n\nDon’t finish your story on a cheap laugh. End with something authentic, moving or thought-provoking. This is what we read / listen to stories for, and it will make yours more memorable.\n@MatthewDicks These have been invaluable tips for me in my book writing journey and I hope they help you too!\n\nCheck out Matthew Dicks book here: https://t.co/aiscUAESvn\n@MatthewDicks If you liked this thread, you can follow me @aliabdaal for daily tweets on health, wealth, love, happiness and impact.",

        "thread": "Being engaging on camera can feel really difficult.\n\nBut it's not just about your personality or what you're saying, it's about the energy that you bring. And to bring the right energy, you have to bring the right mindset.\n\nHere's 5 things I think about before I press record.\n1.  The value of authenticity\n\nWe can assume that being more ‘professional’ + rehearsed will make us more engaging, but it can just feel a bit boring and un-engaging.\n\nTry to be as authentic as you can and show off your personality when you film.\n2.  Overcoming self-doubt\n\nWe all experience self-doubt at the start, because there's a gap between who we are now and where we want to be. At some point, you just have to start believing in yourself.\n\n\"Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right\" - Henry Ford\n3. Imitate, then innovate \n\nWhen you're getting started you'll probably be tempted to imitate your favourite YouTuber. Tbh I think this gives most people some good direction. \n\nI tried to copy @petermckinnon when I started, but then I got more comfortable and was more myself.\n4.  Conquer perfectionism\n\nPerfectionism is rooted in the worry that if something we create isn't amazing, that means we're not either. Every creator struggles with this. \n\nTo get over this, I ask myself 'is this good enough for now?' and if it is, I move on to the bigger fish.\n5. Treat the camera like a friend \n\nTalking to a camera is a really unnatural thing for most people and feels super weird.\n\nA hack I use is just to pretend that someone you know and like is on the other side of the camera, and they're really interested in what you're saying.\nIf you liked this, you might like this free notion template with my camera warm-up drills and tips. This is everything I keep in mind before I press record.\n\nIf you download, you’ll also be signed up for updates on the upcoming Camera Confidence course :)\n\nhttps://t.co/qvuUUDW2Kl",

        "thread": "If you’re struggling to find your next job, this is my honest advice to improve your applications 🧵\n1. Put yourself out there\n\nYou might not find your dream job advertised on LinkedIn or Indeed. Some of my team cold emailed me and pointed out a problem they could help me solve, before I even knew I needed it.\n\nSometimes you have to take the initiative to knock on a new door.📮\n2. Make it easy to say yes\n\nLower the friction for the person you’re contacting to say ‘sure, why not’.\n\n✅ Offer a trial task, no strings attached\n\n✅ Make your offering really clear\n\n✅ Share work you’ve done before - if you don’t have any, mock something up\n3. Build a portfolio\n\nShowcasing past examples of work is a great way to get your foot through the door. You don’t have to have lots of experience… if you’re a writer, work on an example article. If you’re a designer, create a branding suite for your favourite creator, etc.\n4. Keep your resume short + sweet\n\nOnly include your main accomplishments and a bit of personality. Use a simple portfolio website with a builder like @super_ and you’ll be good to go 📈\n5. Don’t shy away from free work…\n\nwithin reason, obvs. Someone applying for my writing internship drafted a whole mock issue of my Sunday Snippets newsletter. 🤩\n\nShowing your work (rather than telling) is golden, and will usually get you an interview.\n6. Match the vibe\n\nMatch the tone of the company you’re communicating with. With Goldman Sachs, a formal cover letter is probably OK. But if you’re applying to a young startup, cut out the ‘Dear Sir/Madam’ and speak their language.\n7. Don’t bullshit\n\nHunt these down and delete them from your application:\n\n❌ Stilted language (”Furthermore…”)\n\n❌ Loads of adjectives (”Intriguing and stimulating…”)\n\n❌ Claims without evidence (”I’m a born salesman.”)\n\n❌ Weird cliches (‘I have a burning passion for…’)\n8. Don’t be over-enthusiastic\n\nDon’t be super-gushy about the company or person you’re applying to. Remember, you want to position yourself as someone who has a solution to their problem. \n\nDescribe what you like most about the company – but be measured + specific.\n9. Try a video application\n\nI’m a big fan of asynchronous interviews and video gives you a better idea of a candidates energy. If the application process doesn’t use video, try sending one anyway to showcase more of your personality. It shows you care.\nBonus: Do an amazing job \n\nSounds like an obvious one, but word-of-mouth is the best marketing. Pitching yourself well helps you to make new connections, which could open doors to other opportunities in the industry you want to be in.\nThat’s it - if you enjoyed the thread, I have a whole video about how to stand out with your CV 👉 https://t.co/qlcylmVtdw",

        "thread": "A few months ago I sat down with the immensely cool magician/ Youtuber/ psychology professor @RichardWiseman to talk about all sorts of interesting things, and I was really fascinated by his thoughts on positive self talk: he doesn’t really believe in it. \n\nWhy? 👇\n1) Performance anxiety 😖\n\nRichard says that positive self talk i.e repeating to yourself ‘I am a good public speaker’ before going out on stage each night, doesn’t work for him. For some people it’s definitely helpful, but he finds it has no effect on his performance.\n2) Backstage rituals 🎪\n\nSo what does he do instead? Richard tells the story of some Vegas magicians he used to know. They would perform back to back shows: day in, day out. He got chatting to them and asked how they could possibly stay excited and enthusiastic about each show.\n3) Did they repeat to themselves ‘Our show will go well’ in the wings of the theatre? No - instead, they would say backstage: \n\n‘One day we will be too old to do this’\n\n‘One day the audience won’t turn up’ \n\n‘At some point this will all go - BUT, not tonight’\n4) Feeling lucky 😎\n\nRather than focusing on what will happen in the future i.e ‘The show WILL go well’, they focused on enjoying the moment. They reminded themselves that they were lucky to be performing - they enjoyed it, they had an audience, and they were good at their jobs.\n5) Antidote to positive thinking? 🌞\n\nThe knowledge that one day we won’t be doing this anymore - whatever ‘this’ is for you - is an antidote to positive thinking. Rather than trying to manifest the future, we should remember that nothing is permanent - and enjoy the present.\nWhat do I think? \n\nI like the perspective shift - it’s very much about enjoying the journey and not focusing on the destination. Saying that, I am trying out the whole positive affirmation thing at the moment to see if it works for me. Will report back in the future on that one.\nIf you want to hear more from Richard, then check out my podcast ep with him. \n\nWe chat about the science of luck, self-development, Vegas, the paranormal, and magic… https://t.co/6rDmle9Q71",

        "thread": "I really believe talking to a camera is one of the most important skills you can develop in the modern world. It gives you a competitive edge and opens the door to countless opportunities. \n\nHere’s a few reasons why:\n1. Provide value at scale\n\nMaking videos on a platform like YouTube, with an algorithm that has the potential to push you, could further your impact. \n\nA teacher in a classroom can only reach a limited number of students, a teacher on YouTube can reach millions.\n2. Develop your confidence and personality\n\nLearning how to talk to a camera has forced me to become more comfortable with my personality. You figure out who you are and what kind of person you want to present to the world as you consistently make content.\n3. Make connections\n\nMost of what I do now is built around the friends and community that have come from speaking to a camera. It sounds weird, but showing your face online is a way of networking with like-minded people.\n4. Forced learning\n\nKnowing I have to make YouTube videos every week forces me to learn more so that I can continue to provide value.\n\nI know I've got stuff to say, but I also know that reading a book means I have something new to share, so I'm more likely to read it.\n5. Define your voice\n\nConstantly speaking to a camera is one of the most powerful ways to figure out what you believe in and what message you want to spread.\n\n@austinkleon said \"I don't write because I have something to say, I write so I figure out what I have to say”\n6. Money\n\nI've shared a lot on YouTube about how much money I've made from talking to a camera.\n\nIt's the value at scale thing. When you help solve problems for lots of people, society compensates you. But for 4 years I was literally just talking to a camera in my bedroom...\nWith those reasons in mind, I decided to make a new course about Camera Confidence where I share everything I know about talking to a camera.\n\nYou'll get to see behind the scenes of how I make videos, my warm up routine and the different techniques I've picked up along the way. https://t.co/G6Bnz2cRvt\nI'll be releasing the course in a few weeks, but if you're interested in hearing more and want access to a free 5 day crash course, sign up here 👇 https://t.co/mCldYYtRq1",

Earning Power\n\nAs you get older, your earning power increases.\n\nSo $100 feels like loads of money as a teenager... but to your future self, it’s peanuts.\n\nSpending that money *right now* on fun experiences will make you happier in the long run. https://t.co/UQy6GsHd2x\n♻️ 2. Memory Dividends\n\nGood experiences deliver compound interest over time. Every year, you’ll get to remember:\n\n🥾 That 2015 hiking trip\n\n🐶 Buying a puppy in 2017\n\n🥳 Epic birthday party in 2019\n\nHave those experiences ASAP, and your future self will thank you.\n⚖️ 3. Asymmetric Risk\n\nTake calculated financial gambles when you’re young, because the risk-reward ratio is asymmetric:\n\n🤑 Best case = become a millionaire\n\n🤷 Worst case = plenty of time to recover https://t.co/WNPFfKzGjQ\n👴 4. Old Age\n\nAs you get old, you generally can’t do as much travel + physical activity.\n\nSo spend money on things like rock climbing or surfing, while you can still enjoy them. 🏄 https://t.co/jhyi3Ystco\nIn a nutshell: gather experience while you’re still young.

Embrace imperfection\n\nSpeaking to a camera is a strange skill, and no one is going to be great when they first start. You just have to remember that people like to listen to people, so embrace your mistakes and lean on your personality.\n2. Get your reps in\n\nNo one learns to master any skill without practicing it a lot first. \n\nThe simplest way to do this? Just get out your phone and start talking to it about whatever you want (without posting it), and do this every day until you don’t feel nervous.\n3. Get in the zone\n\nWhenever I’m about to film something, I try to increase my energy by listening to some music or singing lol. \n\nIt helps me get out of my head and loosen up, so I’m ready to be engaging on camera. I still do this, even after 5 years of practice.\nI decided to make a course on how to master speaking to a camera and feel confident whilst doing so. We talk about mindset, technique, drills and look at case studies of different creators and entrepreneurs.\nIn the course, I coach some of my team who have never spoken to a camera before through some exercises, and analyse the camera presence of creators like Casey Neistat, Mayuko, Jenn Im and myself lol.

        "thread": "I recently turned 28 years old (HBD to me 🥳). \n\nThese are the 28 life lessons I’ve learnt so far:\n1. Set Intentional Defaults\n\nDefaults govern our behaviour. So, setting new defaults is really powerful, like: \n📱Keep your phone in another room for family meals\n⌚ Stop work at 6pm\n🏃 Walk to work every day\n2. Lower the Bar\n\nIf you’re procrastinating on a project, just lower the bar. Say ‘this is going to suck’. It’ll get you started, and you might be surprised at how good your work is.\n3. Embrace Mediocrity\n\nWe have to embrace mediocrity in some areas of life, so we can focus on the handful of things that really matter to us. Decide where you’ll put in the minimum effort.\n4. Work with Background Music\n\nThis makes everything more fun and energising:\n📚 Studying \n👨‍💻 Working \n🧺 Household chores\n5. Quantity and Consistency = Quality\n\n🖼️ To get good at painting, do 100 paintings.\n🎬 To get good at YouTube, film 100 videos.\n\nYour stuff may be terrible, but you'll improve. Put in the reps.\n6. Quantity and Consistency = Creativity\n\nCreativity is a bit like an old tap. You have to turn it on and let all of the crap flow out before you get a flow of clean water. Consistency leads to creative outcomes.\n7. Send Thank You Notes\n\nThis is massively underrated but it’ll feel really good for you and the person you’re writing to.\n8. Planning ≠ Doing\n\nThe metaphor I like to use for this is ‘The Pilot and the Plane’. Sometimes you should be the pilot, and make a plan. The rest of the time you should be the plane, just executing on orders.\n9. Choose to be Satisfied\n\nFeeling dissatisfied isn’t productive, and leads to negative thought spirals. \n\nMake the choice to feel satisfied with the progress you’ve made. You can always do things differently tomorrow.\n10. Move Towards What Energises You\n\nIt’s just one question, but a powerful one: ‘will this energise me, or drain me?’.\n\nThis is an exercise I use whenever I feel overwhelmed and need to prioritise https://t.co/qLvu8ZlFxY\n11. Fantasy Fiction Books are Amazing\n\nFantasy fiction books are absolutely amazing. I always recommend the Mistborn series, it turns people into @BrandSanderson superfans.\n@BrandSanderson 12. Don’t Wipe Your Face with a Bath Towel\n\nSome of you might think ‘so what’ but it’s actually so much better for your skin. Always wipe your face with a different towel to the one you use in the shower so you don’t break out in spots etc.\n@BrandSanderson 13. Have a Simple Skincare Routine\n\nThe earlier you start, the better your skin will look with time. In a nutshell:\n\n☀️ Wear SPF 50 every day\n💧 Always moisturise after showering\n🪄 Look into retinoids\n🚿 Use a good cleanser\n@BrandSanderson 14. Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day\n\nLong lie-ins + irregular sleep will mess up your sleep rhythms. So stick to your usual waking time, even if you didn’t get much sleep the night before.\n\nFor more info check out @hubermanlab\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab 15. Keep a Kindle (Not a Phone) on Your Bedside Table\n\nThis stops me from scrolling mindlessly before bed. I either read my Kindle on warm light mode, or go to sleep.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab 16. Don’t Press the ‘Try Harder Button’\n\nInstead of saying ‘I’ll just grit my teeth and try harder tomorrow’, build systems or an environment that makes work feel easy or fun. This might look like taking an hour in the morning to read or learn before you head into work.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab 17. Monetising Your Passions Is Fun\n\nPeople often say that you should never monetise your passion. But it can often be a rewarding challenge, and way more fun...\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab 18. …Except When It’s Not\n\nLots of YouTubers get burnt out after going full-time. The solution = diversify. Keep some of your hobbies un-monetised and low-stakes.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab 19. Aim to Retire Early \n\n*Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow -* @naval  \n\nI'm trying to ‘retire’ by:\n🤑 Making plenty of money\n✂️ Cutting back on expenses\n🎢 Only doing ‘work’ I’d do for free\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 20. Enjoy Each Day on its Own Merits\n\nStop seeing every day as a stepping stone to something greater. The best feeling in the world is being able to say ‘this was a good day’.\n\nI like using a 'thing I must do' and 'things I might do' list - 'might dos' can get pushed to tomorrow.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 21. Invest in Your Relationships\n\nSuccessful people chronically under-invest in their personal relationships. Spend more time with the people you love.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 22. Always Take the Social Initiative\n\n“People are nice, but you have to go first.” It might be scary, but take the initiative, be the organiser. Amazing things will happen, and people love to be invited to things.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 23. Default to Non-Work in Your Spare\n\nDoing work leads to instant benefits. But relationships need consistent nurturing. If I have a spare hour in my day, I spend it with friends/loved ones.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 24. Exercise in the Morning\n\n🌞 Wakes you up\n⚡ Boosts your energy during the day\n🥱 No groggy evening workouts\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 25. The Sting of Rejection is Better than the Pain of Regret\n\nThis is almost always true. So shoot your shot, instead of always wondering ‘what if’.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 26. Read One-Star Reviews of Your Favourite Books\n\nThere's something very therapeutic about this. You see that everyone’s taste is different, and even things you love have their haters + detractors.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 27. Work on Trains\n\nTrains are a great place to get work done. What’s not to like?\n\n🧑‍💻 Deep work time\n⏩ Effortless travel\n🌳 Climate friendly\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval 28. Journey Before Destination\n\nRemember to live in the present, not the past or future. Whatever destination you set, try to focus on the journey.\n@BrandSanderson @hubermanlab @naval If you liked this thread, you can follow me @aliabdaal for daily tweets on health, wealth, love, happiness and impact. \n\nFor more detail on each of these points, read the full article: https://t.co/7ixVbM5Y4z",

The YouTube Partner Program (YPP)\n2. Sponsorships\n3. Affiliates\n4. Community Earnings\n5. Online Courses\n6. Merchandise\n\nLet's break them down:\n1. The YouTube Partner Program (YPP)\n\nThere are 2 requirements you have to meet before qualifying for the program:\n\n- 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months\n- At least 1000 subscribers\nThis is difficult to achieve and takes the average person 152 videos to reach 1,000 subs on YouTube.\nHow much you can earn from AdSense depends on different factors.\n\nYouTube pays about £1-2 ($2) per 1000 views.\n\nThis number varies hugely based on:\n\n- Watch time\n- The length of the video\n- The type of content you’ve produced\nThis isn't a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nI made 77 videos before I could turn monetisation on.\n\nAnd in 10 months I’d made an admittedly pathetic total of £1.96 ($2.70).\n\nBut the wait was totally worth it.\n\nIn 2021, I made over £330,000 ($440,000) from AdSense 💸 https://t.co/0klmS8amkD\n2. Sponsorships\n\nThis is where brands pay creators a lump sum in exchange for a mention or product placement in a video.\n\nThey can also offer a bonus or reward for additional video engagement or sales.\n\nBut landing a brand deal can take time:\nMy first sponsored video came one year after starting on YouTube.\n\nAt the time, I'd created nearly 150 videos and had around 50,000 subscribers.\n\nSo to say it's tough at the start is an understatement.\nHow much you can earn from sponsors also depends on different factors.\n\nThere’s no simple answer to this, but I'll try my best:\n\nIf you want to land a brand deal, you should charge £15-20 ($20-30) CPM.\n\nIn other words, per 1000 video views you can expect to make between £15&amp; £20.\nSo if you normally get 100,000 views on a video, you should be charging £1500-2000 ($2000-$3000).\n\nBut this isn't a hard and fast rule.\n\nThe biggest YouTubers make well over £70,000 ($100,000) per video.\n3. Affiliates\n\nYou can start this once you've built an audience who know, like and trust you.\n\nThe idea is that companies provide a small commission for driving sales of their product or service.\n\nThe more sales you drive, the more money you’ll ultimately make in return.\nMy tip is to start small.\n\nTry opting for a few affiliate programs like Amazon Affiliates. \n\nAs your audience grows (and more people know, like and trust you), so will your earnings.\nOnce you build your audience and reputation, you can reach out to bigger brands offering larger commissions.\n\nIn 2020 my affiliate income from my top 5 affiliate partnerships was bigger than the money I made from AdSense (£130,000 vs. £100,000).\nHow much can we expect to make from affiliates?\n\nThe average affiliate commission rate sits around 5-25%.\n\nEarnings = commission earned per sale x number of expected sales\n4. Community Earnings\n\nOnce you build a sizeable audience, it's possible to make money creating a community space for them to engage and interact with exclusive content.\n\nA lot of creator friends that I know use @Patreon and say it’s pretty easy to set up.\n@Patreon I haven’t started a paid community yet, but let’s use Patreon as an example:\n\nIf 1-5% of fans become members paying an average of £5 ($7) you could estimate that 30,000 followers would be somewhere between £200 and £1000 ($300-1500) per month.\n@Patreon Something I've delved into is online courses 👇\n@Patreon 5. Online Courses\n\nAs creators, you can capitalise on sharing your knowledge.\n\nI've found there are 3 great ways to do this:\n\n- @Skillshare classes\n- Self-hosted online courses\n- Live cohort-based courses\n@Patreon @skillshare How much you can earn from online courses depends on:\n\n- How much you charge\n- The size of your audience\n- The conversion rate\n\nRevenue = Number of your Audience x Conversion Rate x Price of the Course\n@Patreon @skillshare Lastly, we have merchandise.\n\nWith an audience who like, know and trust you, they’ll also be down to buy some merch in some type of form to show that they’re a part of your community.\n@Patreon @skillshare We’ve recently launched Essentiali which is my stationary brand and there’s so much potential to sell other items like backpacks, mechanical keyboards and clothes. https://t.co/ODwq0aUxuq\n@Patreon @skillshare There are so many ways you can monetise your YouTube channel once you have a system to show up consistently over time.\n\nFor my tips on building a system for YouTube, check out this thread:  https://t.co/TbeANwB6rn\n@Patreon @skillshare I teach the exact framework that got me to 3 million subscribers in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nToday’s the last day to sign-up before the cart closes!

Here’s why 👇\n1. Good thumbnails get you views\n\nLike the picture you choose to use on your Hinge profile, your thumbnail is your first impression and a big deciding factor in whether you get clicks.\n\nNo matter how good your content is, it just won't get seen if your thumbnail isn't good.\nSo, what makes a good thumbnail?\n- Human faces\n- Easily recognisable objects\n- Clear title text that is self-explanatory\n- Bright and airy colour grading https://t.co/4kCFiwRavd\nWhen my team incorporated these different factors, we saw the impact instantly. \n\nThis style of thumbnail has done pretty well for me and it’s a style you can easily use yourself. \n\nThe good thing about using text and icons is that you can use the thumbnail as a future template.\nLearn more about systematising your YouTube channel here: https://t.co/TbeANwB6rn\n2. Good thumbnails build your audience\n\nYou want to attract the right people to your videos.\n\nIf you’ve successfully got their attention, you can make your way through The HIVE Framework that will keep them engaged until the end: https://t.co/k2lf8h9pxV\n3. Good thumbnails build engagement\n\nThe ultimate aim for most budding YouTubers is to build up enough watch time and subscribers to get paid for their content. \n\nIf thumbnails are the first thing viewers see, they are the boundary to growing your engagement.\nI’m always changing my thumbnails to experiment with click-through rates. \n\nHere’s two videos we posted recently with completely different thumbnails: https://t.co/XOl2f7ynkW\nLike most things with content creation, experimentation is key to test your assumptions. If you’re new to YouTube videos, focus on getting to the point where you are posting videos every single week.\nOnce there, it’s time to play around with your thumbnails and titles to increase the % of impressions that lead to views.\nLooking to kickstart your YouTube journey?\n\nLearn more about The Part-Time YouTuber Academy: https://t.co/XqBQ54tGVU",

But if you’re looking to do YouTube part-time, AKA not your main gig, then the closest thing to a magic bullet is a system.\nThis will allow you to grow your channel sustainably, and to plug in other people when the time comes to have a team.\nSystems are basically a set of processes that take us to our desired result.\n\nIn the words of @JamesClear: “Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.”\n\nLet’s assume that our goal is to get 100,000 subscribers.\n@JamesClear To reach 100,000 subscribers on YouTube you’ll need to: \n\n-Have a big list of video ideas \n\n-Write scripts that provide value for every video\n\n-Post at least one video a week for a year\n@JamesClear For tips on how to write scripts check this: https://t.co/UUUzZXah9A\n@JamesClear Consistency is the hardest part about a YouTube channel.\n\nBanking on motivation or willpower to grow your channel won’t cut it.\n\nThat’s why you should be trying to piece together repeatable processes that can become streamlined and/or automated over time.\n@JamesClear Without a system, you’ll be reinventing the wheel every time you film a new video.\n\nThis makes improving your videos more difficult, as there’s nothing standardised to build on top of.\n\nSystem-building is one of the best things we teach in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n@JamesClear In PTYA I share exactly how I grew my channel from 0 to 3 million subscribers while doing YouTube only part-time.\n\nBut the system doesn’t only help you grow your subscribers count.\n\nIt also takes care of major challenges that a YouTuber has to face like👇 https://t.co/5BNINmb5kF\n@JamesClear 🤝 Building a team\n\n🎥 Dealing with cameras, mics, and lighting\n\n💡 Running out of ideas\n\n🏗 Structuring your videos...\n\n💰 Monetising your channel\n\n♻️ Repurposing your content\n\n📨 Outsourcing content production\n\nTo mention only a few.\n\nhttps://t.co/mdkzMfp91Q\n@JamesClear If I could give one piece of advice to someone who wants to make it on YouTube, it would be this:\n\nCreate a system around your production and treat it as a media house.\n\nThis removes motivation and gives you the strongest platform to build from.\n@JamesClear I teach systems thinking and other frameworks in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nIf you’re interested in growing a YouTube channel, grab your place in Cohort 6: https://t.co/pSNA0cm5U6",

        "thread": "The best YouTube videos have a clear structure.\n\nThere are 4 simple steps we can use to hook the viewer and keep them engaged throughout our videos.\n\nThis is the HIVE Framework 👇\nThe HIVE Framework consists of 4 key parts:\n\n1. Hook\n2. Intro\n3. Value\n4. End Screen https://t.co/0fVsELdA6u\n1. The Hook\n\nThe first 10 seconds of your video are critical.\n\nWith our attention spans only getting shorter, you’ve got to keep people engaged by creating a hook that shows them what they’re about to watch.\nThe best hooks address an issue or make an emotional connection with the audience:\n\n-Use enticing b-roll\n\n-Ask a question\n\n-Show a transformation\n\n-Share a thought-provoking fact\n\n-Provide a quick tip\n2. The Intro\n\nThere are broadly three types of videos:\n-Discoverable - hook new viewers into watching more of your videos\n-Community - deepen the relationship with existing viewers\n-Sales - get the viewer to take an action\nTechnically, you only really need an intro for the 'Discoverable' type videos - where your viewership is outside of your core audience.\n\nYou can follow these intro structures:\n👉 “I am X and I do Y.”\n👉 “I help X do Y.”\n👉 “I help X do Y by Z.”\n3. Provide Value \n\nThis is the main chunk of your video. \n\nHow can we add value to our audiences while keeping them engaged?\n\nThere are two main things to think about: the structure, and your writing style.\nThere are broadly 4 types of video structure: \n\n📝 Listicle Structure \n3️⃣ Triplet Structure \n🎵 Quartet Structure\n📚 Story Structure\n📝 Listicle\n\nThe more you speak from personal experience, the lower lift creating consistent videos will be. \n\nListicles are great because you can literally riff off 5-10 things and provide clear value to your audience while doing so.\n3️⃣ Triplet\n\nThis is really helpful for topics where you have three broader statements, but you want to give the audience action points within those.\n\nWithin each of your 3 main points, you’ve got a number of smaller points.\n\nThis is a good example: https://t.co/m1sqYQ2CRa\n🎵 Quartet\n\nWhy, What, How and What If?\n\nThis structure works incredibly well for educational videos or topics where you want to convince the user that said topic is going to be a positive change.\n\nIt also works great for sales videos when you want the audience to follow a CTA.\n📚 Story \n\nA more creative way of getting your point across. \n\nThe Hero’s Journey is commonly used by fiction authors, but when you simplify it’s actually quite similar to the Quartet approach with a bit more flair. \n\nThink more B-Roll, story-telling and personal experiences. https://t.co/PZWgAkqyy3\n4. The End Screen \n\nIf the viewer has got to the end of your video, they’re probably your ideal audience. Now your main aim is to keep them on your channel.\n\nThe best ending to a video is when your audience doesn't even realise it's the end.\nAt the end of your video, create a segue to point the audience towards another similar or helpful video of yours, using an \"if\" or story to lead into it.\n\nEven if you haven’t made the next video yet, start to create links between your content.\nBonus tip: Make use of YouTube's end cards to give viewers a visual cue right on screen.\nThat’s the HIVE framework of how to structure your YouTube videos.\n\nI teach this framework and many others in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nJoin Cohort 6 👇 https://t.co/yKFZaH6FoJ",

        "thread": "Staring at the data in YouTube Studio can become very complicated, but it’s a goldmine for coming up with new ways to improve your videos.  \n\nThese are the 3 metrics that matter the most 👇\nI’ve spoken to loads of my YouTube friends and worked with coaches to dive into the analytics.\n\nFrom all of these conversations, everything usually comes back to the same 3 metrics:\n\n1. Click-Through Rate (CTR)\n2. Audience Retention\n3. Returning + Unique Viewers\n1. Click-Through Rate (CTR)\nYouTube measures the % of clicks that come from the YouTube homepage, recommendation section or trending section. \n\nThis is the most important metric to see how your title and thumbnails are performing.\nA high CTR means:\n\n-The title + thumbnail were compelling\n\n-The topic resonated with the audience\n\nA low CTR means:\n-You need to update the title and/or thumbnail\nBut CTR only tells you whether you’ve earned the click.\n\nYou should also compare it against other metrics like 'average percentage viewed' and 'average view duration'. This’ll tell you how engaged your audience is after they click.\nA low CTR but a high watch time could mean the video is interesting but the thumbnail sucks. At least this tells you what needs to be changed!\nIt’s likely your first title/thumbnail combo won’t be the best so you should also try to A/B test titles and thumbnails all the time.\n\nI’ve always got at least 20 A/B tests constantly running on @TubeBuddy so that we’re optimising everything and coming to a data-driven conclusion\n@TubeBuddy 2. Audience Retention\n\nYouTube rewards content with a high view duration - which basically means if people are watching a good portion of your video, it'll be pushed out to more people in search rankings and suggestions. https://t.co/HmR3j2r8Vs\n@TubeBuddy You can analyse audience retention under the engagement tab. From here, you can figure out where viewers started to trail off or if there are parts that are rewatched.\n\nThis is really cool and can help you improve your scripting or give you video ideas for the future.\n@TubeBuddy 3. Returning + Unique Viewers\n\nChecking the amount of ‘returning viewers’ coming back to your channel is important. This shows whether or not you’re growing an engaged audience.\n\n‘Unique viewers’ are the opposite, they're new viewers visiting your channel. https://t.co/ZDyj34NkT4\n@TubeBuddy It's worth analysing both returning and unique visitors to understand the actual size of the audience watching your video. \n\nIdeally, you want a 60/40 split leaning towards unique viewers. This is a solid indication that your audience is growing.\n@TubeBuddy After a chat with Europe’s biggest tech YouTuber @Mrwhosetheboss, I realised the importance of spending more time in YouTube Studio:\n\nhttps://t.co/9QAbAqJ7nu\n@TubeBuddy @Mrwhosetheboss Want to grow on YouTube faster?\n\nSign up for a new and improved version of my 7-day Part-Time YouTuber Crash Course.\n\nI'll teach you how to get started with YouTube straight to your inbox: https://t.co/8KvuQ2Snf1\n@TubeBuddy @Mrwhosetheboss Cohort 6 of my Part-Time YouTuber Academy starts soon.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about PTYA, join the waiting list for cohort 6: https://t.co/qlpjEjXWII",

Here’s what I’ve learned about crafting the perfect script 👇\nI typically consider 5 core factors that go into my scripts:\n\n1. Fast, Bad, Wrong\n2. Adding A-roll and Voiceovers\n3. Minimising repetition\n4. Adding flair\n5. Creating intellectual property\n1. Fast, Bad, Wrong (FBR)\n\nWe all have unfair advantages that we can tap into.\n\nMost of us let perfectionism creep in before we even get started with filming videos.\n\nMy best advice is to outline the 5-7 points you want to talk about super quickly and refine the script later.\n2. Adding A-roll and Voiceovers\n\nAs you script your video, think about ways you can spice things up.\n\nWhen I first started YouTube, I recorded a bunch of random B-Roll clips in one sitting - flicking through books, scrolling on the iPad etc. I still use them to this day.\n3. Minimising repetition\n\nIt's normal to want to summarise things at the end of a point, but this will probably make your viewers bored and result in them clicking away.\n\nClearly define each point and the key message in your script, and try to train yourself into sticking to it.\n4. Adding flair\n\nAs we grow as creators, our audience becomes more interested in our personality.\n\nThink about how you can present value in a different way that's memorable:\n\n-Give a structure a new name\n-Add funny headings to your steps\n-Use familiar objects in B-Roll\n5. Creating intellectual property\n\nGiving a simple concept a name gives it power and will benefit the user by helping the concept to stick in their mind.\n\nIf you’re successful in this, people will talk about that structure with the name you gave it.\nThis worked when I shared how I use Notion as my “Resonance Calendar”:\n\nhttps://t.co/UvVhjnmRVb\nBonus tip 💫 - Visualise concepts\n\nWhen writing your script, stop to consider if it would be easier to show something, rather than just talk about.\n\nThis could be having a book to hand that you pick up, or dropping images into the video when it comes to editing.\nWhatever it is, this will really help to keep the viewer engaged to the end.\nIf you found this helpful, why not learn the other frameworks I teach to budding YouTubers in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nJoin the waiting list for the next cohort: https://t.co/ibmpXBA14n",

        "thread": "It’s taken me 5 years to get to 3m subscribers on YouTube.\n\nHere’s 10 things I’ve learned along the way 👇\n1. Consistency matters\n\nIn the early days on YouTube, nobody cares about your videos.\n\nIt’s likely that you’ll be the only person who watches all of the videos on your channel until the end. This isn’t a bad thing, it’s actually liberating. Film, hit publish and repeat.\n2. Gear doesn’t matter at the start\n\nDo you have a phone? Is there something that you’re passionate about?\n\nNice - you can now write, record and edit a YouTube video. It’s really as simple as that.\n3. Don’t worry about the numbers\n\nIt took me 52 videos over 6 months to get my first 1000 subscribers.\n\nDon’t focus in on the data too much at the start. Just consistently make videos and let the data build up in YouTube Studio. https://t.co/EUQtZqc7c2\n4. Stack the deck in your favour \n\n‘Stacking the deck’ means that you’re doing all of the small actions you can to increase your chances of success. \n\nDon’t struggle to figure out everything alone- ask friends for feedback, get advice on your filming set-up, and work in public.\n5. Use your Unfair Advantages\n\nIn the book The Unfair Advantage, authors @StartupHasan and @Ash_Ali share the hidden factors behind success.\n\nWhat makes you different? How can you capitalise on that?\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali After posting consistently for months, I did a collaboration with @IbzMo about study tips that really helped my channel to start to grow. \n\nSuccess on YouTube = Work x Luck x Your Unfair Advantage\n\nhttps://t.co/vIni7PZuVd\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo 6. Focus on quantity over quality\n\nThe more videos you make, and the more mistakes you make = the more you learn. Don’t focus on being polished straight away - quality is developed over time.\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo To achieve quantity as you grow, you can begin to outsource certain tasks like finding a great video editor on @fiverr or levelling up your production quality with high-quality sound from @epidemicsound 😃\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound 7. Don’t worry about your niche \n\nIf you focus on making the things you enjoy, your niche will develop over time. Don’t overthink it.\n\nI have a full blog on the topic if you’d like more tips 👇 https://t.co/WZboelPpb2\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound 8. Be patient and consistent \n\nSuccess on YouTube doesn’t happen overnight. Not even for @MrBeast or your favourite YouTuber.\n\nYou’ll probably make no money for your first 50-100 videos, but you will improve at camera confidence, editing and scripting.\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast 9. Think about systems\n\nCreate a system that works for you and stick to it. It’s a good idea to see what other YouTubers are doing for inspiration, but make sure you tweak it so that it’s relevant to your situation.\n\nCapture your ideas, plan a publishing schedule and get moving.\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast 10. Just publish\n\nWith your phone or camera, press record and start uploading content.\n\nIn my early days, I saved some of my best ideas until I had the beginning of an audience. I knew that I needed to focus on reps before expecting my videos to do anything.\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast Don’t procrastinate or overthink things.\n\nYouTube is fun - focus on the journey, not the destination.\n@StartupHasan @Ash_Ali @IbzMo @fiverr @epidemicsound @MrBeast If you found this helpful, why not learn the other frameworks I teach to budding YouTubers in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nJoin the waiting list for the next cohort: https://t.co/NFjt3bAWAj",

        "thread": "After chatting to hundreds of creators, here’s my strategy for never running out of content ideas:\n1. A → Ask Your Audience\n\nEven if you’re just starting with content creation speaking to your audience and working in public is a good idea.\n\nThis doesn’t have to be social media followers, it can be family, friends or colleagues.\n\nBegin the habit of asking for input.\nIf you’ve got an audience that knows, likes and trusts you - use it. This could be sharing a tweet or putting up a quick Instagram Story.\n\nIf you don’t have an audience, just explain to friends and family what your channel’s about and what they’d like to know about that subject.\n2. B → The Birdsong Technique\n\nAs a content consumer, you passively enjoy what other people have created.\n\nYou’re a bit oblivious to any intention behind the content, apart from that it's cool/ informative.\n\nOnce we appreciate certain sounds, we tune into what they're signalling\nWhen you become a creator, you’ll realise that ideas are everywhere. Your Twitter feed is no longer a wave of text - it’s thoughts, concepts and lessons.\n\nIf the content you consume is very different from the content you create, something is going wrong.\nConsuming the type of content that you want to emulate is a good idea. You can steal like an artist from your favourite creators and it genuinely helps with finding your own content style. \n\nVariety is important, but ideally, you'll regularly consume content similar to your own.\n3. C → Coal Mining\n\nA coal mine is an area where you're likely to find coal (i.e. video ideas) if you start digging.\n\nThis coal can then be used to create diamonds (i.e. banging video content).\nCoal mines could be Twitter lists, Reddit threads, Instagram pages, newsletters and even other YouTube channels.\n\nWhenever you find one of these mines, make a note of the link and refer back to it whenever you’re feeling short of ideas.\nCoal mining isn’t about plagiarising or copying content, it’s about taking inspiration to create your own stuff.\n\nIn the words of one of my favourite authors @austinkleon : “nothing is original”. \n\nI’d recommend reading Steal Like An Artist for more about this topic: https://t.co/Gr74Ys9AgM\n@austinkleon The ABC method is only as good as the system behind it.\n\nIf you don't have a system to properly store/capture your ideas you're only going to forget them: https://t.co/TLiU4ikTMB\n@austinkleon Without enough ideas for YouTube videos, you’ll stop publishing consistently.\n\nIf you found this helpful, why not learn the other frameworks I teach to budding YouTubers in my Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\n\nJoin the waiting list for the next cohort: https://t.co/S9N0uoP6th",

Get Going\n\nThe biggest resistance to success is just getting started.\n\nYou're probably using one of these 3 things as an excuse to not start:\n\n- You’re worried what people will say\n- You don't have the equipment\n- You’re not sure what video to make first\nAll you have to do is turn your thinking around.\n\n- No one actually cares, they'll probably think it’s cool\n- You literally need a phone camera to start\n- You can make videos about anything, and at the start, you should\nJust start by making one video.\n\nOnce you've made one video, try to make one video a week.\n\nBe okay with publishing one video at a time and don’t worry about the bigger picture or the quality until later on.\n2. Get Good\n\nThe more we create YouTube videos, the better they will be.\n\nMy answer to the content quality vs. quantity debate is that quantity leads to quality. \n\nIt’s important to know what stage you’re in with your channel, so you can direct time and energy to what’s needed.\n3. Get Smart\n\nUntil you're posting regular videos, don’t worry about niching down your channel. \n\nYou'll get a better return if you focus more on making good videos and less time on planning the future of your channel. Use great sites like @fiverr to find freelance support.\n@fiverr Want to follow more structures for how to improve on YouTube? \n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the Part-Time YouTuber Academy, hear from previous students and see the improvements we’ve made for Cohort 6.\n\nJoin the waiting list: https://t.co/pfYnrnXfyZ",

        "thread": "6 tips to master your productivity:\n1. Focus on systems\n\nThere is a distinction between goals and systems. \n\nThe goal is the thing we want to achieve, the systems are the process and the thing that we do to get to the goal. Instead of focusing on the goal, focus on how you’ll get there.\n2. Create a daily highlight\n\nEvery day, decide on one thing you want to get done and focus on that one thing.\n\nIt can be anything from work-related tasks or personal stuff. Imagine the impact we could make in a year if every day we could focus on our priorities.\n3. Consume content at 2-3x speed\n\nImagine being able to get through content at twice the speed. It’s absolutely life-changing.\n\nYou can sometimes find more enjoyment in content when it’s quicker, like audiobooks/ TV shows. \n\nYou consume double the amount and increase productivity\n4. Delegate tasks\n\n@tferriss talks about this in his book The 4-Hour Work Week, one of the books that most changed my life.\n\n@naval also talks about the idea of setting an aspirational hourly rate.\n\nDelegate anything you don't enjoy if the cost is less than your aspirational rate\n@tferriss @naval 5. Time-blocking\n\nBlock out time for a particular task/project, so when the time comes around, you end up doing it.\n\nWhen you see an empty gap in the calendar, you might end up paralysed by the thought of different things you could be doing.\n\nDefine your tasks and complete them\n@tferriss @naval 6. Enjoy the journey\n\nAt the end of the day, enjoying the journey is the ultimate productivity hack.\n\nWhen we enjoy the journey and have fun, productivity takes care of itself.\n\nYou don't have to worry about distraction or procrastination from doing something you genuinely enjoy.\n@tferriss @naval If you enjoyed this thread, why not sign up for Sunday Snippets?\n\nEvery Sunday, I share actionable productivity tips, practical life advice, and high-quality insights from across the web, directly to your inbox.\n\nJoin 137,000+ friendly readers: https://t.co/3hTDlf3ibo",

        "thread": "How to be more intentional with your time:\n1. Practice Doing Nothing\n\nIn the modern world, we all feel the need to constantly be busy or ‘hustling’.\n\nBut we should resist the urge to manipulate experiences. Rediscover rest, do things you enjoy with no clear end goal or future purpose, like walks or playing video games.\n2. Pay Yourself First\n\nDo your most important activity - the thing you are doing for yourself - first.\n\nMost of us try to fit these activities in at the end of the day when all other work / family commitments are done.\n\nPrioritise yourself in the best hours of your day.\n3. Limit Your ‘Work in Progress’\n\nStop trying to get things done all at once and limit time in progress.\n\nA good way to achieve this is to operate a two-column open and closed list:\n\nOpen list = all tasks, to do’s and projects\n\nClosed list = most important tasks (a maximum of 10)\n4. Decide When to Fail\n\nWe are inevitably going to fail at some things.\n\nIdentify the stuff you absolutely have to do like paying bills and taxes. Then decide where you want to just do the bare minimum - a failure you are happy to accept.\n5. Single task\n\nWhen you have your list of things to do, focus on one big project at a time until you complete it.\n\nChoose the bigger tasks first instead of small, easily tasks, this can actually make things more efficient.\n\nWe don’t need to do 18 things at once.\nIf you want to learn more about being intentional with your time, here’s how @ElonMusk manages his workload 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/IQxpUNgfq8\n@elonmusk If you enjoyed this thread, why not sign up for Sunday Snippets\n\nEvery Sunday, I share actionable productivity tips, practical life advice, and high-quality insights from across the web, directly to your inbox.\n\nJoin 137,000+ friendly readers: https://t.co/3hTDlf3ibo",

        "thread": "My relationship with setting goals has always been mixed, but I’ve finally settled on a system that works for me.\n\nHere’s my 9-step goal-setting system for success. I call this The Anti-Wasteman System👇\n1. What’s your goal or dream?\n\nFirst, decide exactly what it is that you want to achieve.\n\nCurrently one of my goals is to write a book that I'm proud of - so I'll use that as an example.\n2. Why do you want to achieve this goal? What will it do for you and give you?\n \nFor me, writing a book is fun. I've always wanted to do it and it could be an interesting way of reaching new audiences.\n3. Make it S.M.A.R.T\n\nWhilst I don't really stick to the whole SMART goal thing, it's super important to give yourself a target to meet with a specific date.\n\nThis way, you know you have something to work towards and you can also review your progress.\n4. Form your habits\n\nWhat habits will make the thing more likely to happen? Add one new habit at a time to your routine to stay consistent and take steps forward.\n\nFor example, I’ve scheduled 3 hours per week to write my book.\n5. “How surprised would I be if I failed?”\n\nRate this on a scale of 1-10, 1 being not very surprised and 10 being extremely surprised.\n\nI'd give writing my book a 7 given I'd be reasonably surprised if I wasn't able to hit the deadlines set.\n6. List the top 3 reasons you might fail\n\nPeople tend to avoid this one out of fear that they will fail, but this is something I've found really useful.\n\nThis might be for example:\n- Not having enough time\n- The task is taking longer than expected\n- Urgent things cropping up\n7. Who can help?\n\nWho Not How by @BenjaminPHardy and @DanSullivanSC encourages us to first ask “Who can help?”\n\nYou don’t have to complete your goal alone and it’s likely to be the case that finding help achieves it faster. https://t.co/PHhfCivlLf\n@BenjaminPHardy @DanSullivanSC 8. How can I stack the deck to succeed? \n\nThis can be:\n- Making sure you always have time in your calendar\n- Telling other people about your goal for accountability\n- Being prepared so that action is easier\n@BenjaminPHardy @DanSullivanSC 9. Define your actions\n\nList down exactly how you will ensure your goal is a success, this is similar to forming your habits but a little more specific. \n\nFor example, I’ve time blocked hours in the mornings for writing as that’s when I focus the most.\n@BenjaminPHardy @DanSullivanSC To stay on track with your targets, download my @Notion template for the Anti-Wasteman system here: https://t.co/KpJEwFEYdf\n\nLet me know if this helps you 😃",

And it feels like nothing - 1/ https://t.co/AgJ5szg7Ih\nNot because I knew it was coming - YouTube analytics makes that obvious. But because I've tried my best over the years to innoculate myself against caring about numbers. 2/\nDon't get me wrong - I super appreciate every one of the 3M subscribers and 4-7M viewers each month. It's incredible that so many people seem to want to listen to the random shit that spews out of my mouth on video. 3/\nBut I've found that the less I actually care about numbers, the happier I seem to be. The more I focus on the journey, and less on the destination, the more fun I have doing this thing I love. 4/\nThere's another part of it too - looking at numbers makes comparisons way too easy. Yes, I'm on 3M subscribers, but @Mrwhosetheboss is on 10M. Yes, I'm on 3M but @jackbenedwards is on 1M and he's getting way more views per video than I am. 5/\nAm I fading into irrelevancy? Will I become one of those has-beens who have millions of subscribers but tiny views on their videos? Would my business crumble around me when that happens? 6/\nIt probably seems absurd to you that I'd be worrying about that stuff. As my friend @p_millerd recently wrote about me, \"He’s killing it by all traditional metrics\". It's very kind of Paul to say, but metrics are a double-edged sword. 7/\nWhile the audience looks at the numbers are thinks \"whoah\", the creator looks at the trend. Half the time we think \"phew, we're still up\". But the other half of the time, we think \"oh shit, the numbers are grey or red, will I lose everything and end up broke and homeless?\" 8/ https://t.co/zeiWovu7v3\nThis is my complicated relationship with numbers. Over the past 5 years, I've tried to dissociate my self-worth from the numbers. That's helped be more okay putting out videos that don't perform well. But it's also helped me shrug when the numbers are high, or hit amilestone. 9/\nMaybe there's a healthier way of dealing with this. Maybe there's a way to genuinely feel joy and gratitude as the numbers go up, and simultaneously __not__ feel deep sadness when they trend down. If there is, I haven't figured it out yet. 10/\nAnyone got any ideas? \n\nBtw, this is the self-indulgent stuff I opine about in my weekly email newsletter, Sunday Snippets. If you care, you can signup at my Twitter profile page apparently :) \n\nThanks for reading, would appreciate any advice 😀",

Online Tutoring\n\nThe best thing about tutoring- you can start wherever you are in your journey, as long as you have the level of qualification you're teaching- you're good to go\n\nWhen at med school, I created a business called 6Med where I helped others to get into university.\n3. No-Code Website Design\n\nBack in the day, I learnt how to code and built websites to make some cash. Nowadays you have tools like Ghost or Notion that make it easier to design websites without coding.\n\nBut, I do recommend learning to code, it’s invaluable in many industries.\n4. Private Consulting\n\nWe can all get information online for free, however to speed up progress, some people prefer to pay for a consultation.\n\nShare what you know and get paid for it.\n5. Notion Consulting\n\nIf you have a great working knowledge of @Notion and enjoy problem solving, this one could be for you.\n\nFast-growing startups and creators need their knowledge documented in different ways. Knowing how to use workspace tools is a very valuable skill.\n@notion 6. Grow a Paid Newsletter\n\nSo this is a bit more of a ‘long-game’ side-hustle, but anyone can start a newsletter about a topic that really interests them. To get started, choose a newsletter platform, plan your first few pieces of content, and start posting consistently.\n@notion 7. Writing for Businesses\n\nBeing a good writer is an indispensable skill in life. Every business you come across needs website copy, social media content, marketing material, a newsletter, the list goes on…\n@notion How can you get started? Choose your skill, work on your elevator pitch, have examples at the ready, and get pitching to local or online businesses 🚀\n@notion If you want a more in-depth guide for starting these side hustles, check out my YouTube video on the topic here: https://t.co/0GR6ywOHOF",

        "thread": "Here’s how to learn anything x2 faster:\n1. Sharpen the Axe\n\nAbraham Lincoln said “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe”\n\nIn other words, we need to first work out how we're actually going to learn the thing.\n2. Optimise Focus\n\nWhen we fully focus on learning, our brains pick things up much faster.\n\nThe 5-minute rule helps when we're finding it difficult to start- just work on the thing for 5 minutes. We can stop after this, but usually once you've started, you'll want to continue.\n3. Find Opportunities for Immersion\n\nThe general principle is that we learn best when we're in the environment we're actually going to be using the skill in.\n\nMy advice: step out of your comfort zone and fully immerse yourself by doing the thing you want to learn.\n4. What’s Your Weakest Link?\n\nWe actually want to focus on our weaknesses instead of our strengths when learning.\n\nIf you took an exam tomorrow, what would you be least happy with if it came up? Identify the weak points and get ready to test yourself.\n5. Test Yourself\n\nThe idea behind active recall is that we don't learn by trying to put stuff into our brains.\n\nCounterintuitively, we learn by trying to take stuff out of our brains. Think of testing as a way to reinforce knowledge (more in this video https://t.co/5GFCaG3otu)\n6. Get Regular Intense Feedback\n\nAt the start of any learning journey, we need to inject positivity and enthusiasm, rather than necessarily critical feedback.\n\nBut, if we start taking learning seriously, focus on critical and constructive feedback from tutors or peers to improve.\n7. Over-learn\n\nWhen we're learning something we actually want to try and learn it in more depth than we necessarily need to.\n\nThe idea here is to continuously be asking why a thing works the way that it does.\n8. Use Spacing\n\nThe idea is that we need to learn the same thing at spaced intervals if we want to encode it into our long-term memory.\n\nBy spacing out the practice of this thing, eventually it's going to become muscle memory.\n9. Teach What You're Learning\n\nAs a general policy, whenever I'm learning something I'll document the process.\n\nThis helps me to double check that I've understood the concept properly and solidifies my learning. You can do this by writing it down or trying to teach a friend.\n10.

If you're procrastinating on a project, like starting a YouTube channel, try to *ambush your future self*. 👇 1/\nSort out all the logistics of the project to the point where there's basically nothing left to do. Then, in a moment of weakness (or strength) your future self might decide “screw it I’ll just pull the trigger”. And you’ll do the thing. 2/\n📹 e.g. YouTube: Make your first video, but set it as “Private”. Your future self will only need to press one button to make the video public. 3/\n💘 Or set up your dating app profile “just in case” without “intending” to actually use it. You’re just setting it up.  4/\nThe project itself is usually kind of fun. It's just the final step that's kind of 'ugh, maybe let's not'. So set an ambush for your future self, to make it as easy as possible to pull the trigger. 5/5",

But waiting isn't going to help, in fact, ‘doing’ is usually the best form of learning.\n2. Stand on the shoulders of giants\n\nThere's loads of books, podcasts, websites, articles and interviews that you can take inspiration from for a jump start.\n\nAny situation you're in has been figured out by somebody else. Learn from their mistakes to save yourself time.\n3. Learn to code\n\nKnowing the basics of how to code is really valuable. Learning to code opens up your mind to potential business ideas and flexes your problem-solving muscles.\n4. Learn the basics of design \n\nWhether it's making a website look eye-catching or understanding the principles behind branding, this can add production value to anything you want to create.\n5. Do it with friends\n\n“If you want to go fast, you should go alone; if you want to go far, you should go together”.\n\nI've always gone further with projects that I've enjoyed and a key component of that is working with others.\n6. Start small\n\nYour million-dollar business will look very different at the start to how it looks at the end. Concentrate on the basics and focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - the smallest version of your product that you can get in front of people.\n7. Do things that don’t scale\n\nIn an essay by @paulg, he mentions that new businesses should put extra effort into understanding their customers to gain qualitative feedback. \n\nWhen the business has grown, this can become harder to do as you focus on growth activities.\n@paulg 8. Expect to fail and learn from it\n\nThe chances are that your startup won't succeed. It’s the hard truth, but failures are valuable and you can learn from your mistakes to help you with further projects.\n@paulg 9. Ask yourself why\n\nTo quote @sivers: “Never forget why you are really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?”\n@paulg @sivers 10. Just start \n\nTo quote @tferriss: \"Someday\" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you...if it's important to you and you want to do it 'eventually' just do it and correct course along the way.",

Group B had to work on a single pot for the whole 30 days...\nAt the end of the month, Brian judged the quality of the pots\n\nWithout exception, every one of the top 10 pots came from Group A, the guys that made one pot per day. None came from the group that focused on perfecting their single pot\nI’ve had messages from students interested in starting various things - YouTube channels, blogs, photography, video editing, all sorts. They’ve been asking for advice on how to get started, or how to improve\nMy advice is to always focus on quantity over quality, at least for the first few years\n\nAiming for quantity has another benefit - it stops the fear of “what if this isn’t good enough?” from paralysing us\n\nWe accept that as beginners, we’re going to suck and that’s okay\nI’m so so glad that I heard about ‘the parable of the pottery class’ before I got started with YouTube\n\nWithout it, I’d still be obsessing over trying to make my first video ‘perfect’ before putting it online\nwhat do you struggle with most when it comes to starting something new?",

        "thread": "Ever struggling trying to find focus? Here’s 5 different techniques that I use to stay focused that you may want to try\n1.  Embrace Welcome Distractions\n\nThis may sound a bit like I’m contradicting myself here but there’s a difference between welcome and unwelcome distractions\nA welcome distraction could be a chat with a close friend, a call from a loved one, or an activity that brings joy and added value to your life\nAn unwelcome distraction could be a notification on your phone, an unexpected phone call from your bank or loud noises from right above your apartment\nThe key to making this work is to know which distractions bring you value (embrace those) and which are essentially time-eaters that bring nothing to the table and stop you from doing valuable work\n2. Optimise for Enjoyment\n\n🎮 Gamify the process- divide tasks into smaller bits and tick them off one at a time. This makes it easier and more satisfying to complete the work\n3. Throw Away the Phone\n\nNot literally, but put it out of view. One notification can lead to hours of scrolling (I think we’ve all fallen into this trap)\nWhenever I have something important to do I put my phone a few feet away from my desk - usually face down and on airplane mode - so that there's less temptation to pick it up and get sucked in\n4. Control your Environment\n\nMy desk used to be full of stuff that would grab my attention and make it harder to concentrate on what I needed to do, especially when I started to get bored\n5. Deliberately Manage your Time\n\nPlanning and scheduling things out can massively free us from distraction. If you can plan your time and stick to it, then we don’t leave ourselves open to distractions or a lack of focus\nLet me know if you try any of these and which ones help you out 😃",

Sharing your writing in public will improve the quality of your work.\n\nNot sure what you want to write about? Just start ✍️\n@david_perell Twitter is the internet home for ideas.\n\nWrite about different topics and gauge people's reactions.\n\nIf something is working and resonates with your audience, do more of it.\n\nRemember: get going and then get good 😃\n@david_perell 🏁 1 Starting Out - YouTube\n\nThe immediate disadvantage is that you need equipment.\n\nBut, you can actually start YouTube BY writing.\n\nBlogging and social media can give you the push to put yourself out there.\n@david_perell A great place to start with writing is to follow the idea of the Architect vs. the Archaeologist ⛏️\n\nYou can read my thread about the difference here https://t.co/fPp3WCKPDT\n@david_perell Architects plan everything out before they start building.\n\nArchaeologists choose promising areas and start digging until they find something good.\n\nWhen starting out, be an archaeologist. Once experienced, be an architect.\n\nFirst, quantity &gt; quality\n\nThen, quality &gt; quantity\n@david_perell 📈 2 Getting Better - Writing\n\nPay attention to HOW people compliment you, listen and cultivate.\n\nAccording to @david_perell, for your writing to P.O.P it needs to be:\n-Personal\n-Observational\n-Playful\nIf you have all 3, that tends to be very good writing.\n@david_perell Another one of @david_perell’s genius frameworks is around how to ask for feedback.\n\nDavid has a method he calls C.R.I.B.S which can turn any novice into an editor. This allows you to receive feedback from other people as they can focus on how your writing makes them feel.\n@david_perell For example, is it:\n\n-Confusing\n-Repeated\n-Insightful\n-Boring\n-Surprising\n\nEventually, you'll refine your skills and they'll become a bigger part of your style. Style is your personality on the page 🎨\n@david_perell 📈 2 Getting Better - YouTube\n\nRecognise the compliments but also what content ideas the audience is giving you. This way, you know your work actually adds value.\n\nAlways ask the people in your life and audience for feedback. \n\nRemember, your vibe attracts your tribe 🤙\n@david_perell Use comments and analytics to get useful feedback. Don't worry about making every video better, just slowly improve over time.\n\nYou can start by documenting the things you’re already learning, before moving on to tackling new information to create content around.\n@david_perell 🚀 3 Unfair Advantages - Writing\n\nWhat may come naturally to you, may be hard for other people.\n\nTo quote @naval, \"Do what looks like play to others but feels like play to you\".\n\nCompliments lead to competence. They help you sharpen your skills and get better.\n@david_perell @naval 🚀 3. Unfair Advantages - YouTube\n\nIn the book Unfair Advantage, authors @StartupHasan and @Ash_Ali outline the MILES framework which is a great way to think about your own niche:\n\n-Money\n-Intelligence and Insight\n-Location and Luck\n-Education and Expertise\n-Status\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 4 Growing Your Audience - Writing\n\nRide a wave of ideas, people, and trends. Imitate then innovate.\n\nTake an existing idea and make sense of it.\n\nWhat’s missing?\n\nThat's the originality that YOU bring. End with originality, don’t start with it.\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 4. Growing Your Audience - YouTube\n\nChase trends, look at similar channels to yours and identify why certain videos did well.\n\nTake an idea and add your value to it.\n\nRemember that nothing out there is original, everything is a remix of something else.\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali 💰 5 Monetisation - Writing\n\nYou want people to come to you, establish yourself as an expert and identify gaps in the market.\n\nListen to your audience and understand what they need you'll know it's time to start monetising when people ask you.\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali 💰 5 Monetisation - YouTube\n\nIt’s built-in with AdSense so at a certain point, by default, you'll make money.\n\nOnce you reach 10-20k subs, sponsors will start reaching out to you.\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali When you deliver valuable content for free for a long time, and you know what people want, your craft sells itself👇\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali If you want to learn the craft of online writing, sign up to David’s free 50-day email course https://t.co/vWLNbj8sTJ\n@david_perell @naval @StartupHasan @Ash_Ali If building an audience online excites you, check out my full YouTube video How To Make Money Online in 2022 with David 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/cxcgEP2VLM",

Thinking failure does the exact opposite. ” - David Swartz \n\nHere are my main takeaways from 'The Magic of Thinking Big\"  👇\n1. Be an activationist.\n\nBe someone who does things. Be a doer, not a don’t-er.\n2. Don’t wait until conditions are perfect. They never will be.\n\nExpect future obstacles + difficulties and solve them as they arise.\n3. Remember, ideas alone won’t bring success.\n\nIdeas have value only when you act upon them. Use action to cure fear and gain confidence.\n\nDo what you fear, and fear disappears. Just try it and see.\n4. Start your mental engine mechanically. \n\nDon’t wait for the spirit to move you. Take action, dig in, and you move the spirit.\n5. Think in terms of now.\n\nTomorrow, next week, later, and similar words often are synonymous with the failure word, never.\n\nBe an “I’m starting right now” kind of person.\n6. Get down to business—pronto.\n\nDon’t waste time getting ready to act. Start acting instead.\n7. Seize the initiative.\n\nBe a crusader. Pick up the ball and run. Be a volunteer. Show that you've got the ability and ambition to do.\n\"Remind yourself regularly that you are better than you think you are. Successful people are not supermen. Success does not require a superintellect.\"\n\"Successful people are just ordinary folks who have developed belief in themselves and what they do. Never, yes never, sell yourself short.\"\nSo there we have it friends, believe in yourself and you can't go far wrong 😃",

The Elevator Pitch\n\nFiguring out what my elevator pitch is.\n\nAll great non-fiction books (like Atomic Habits, Show Your Work, The Black Swan) have one key takeaway message.\n@PenguinBooks I started writing my book based on the 5,000 word proposal I sent to Penguin (which they really liked). but while writing my first + second drafts, I realised that my proposal had MULTIPLE messages.\n@PenguinBooks having multiple messages is a problem because it dilutes the main message that we’re trying to get across to the readers, and makes the elevator pitch less clear.\n@PenguinBooks 2. Structuring\n\nThe last few weeks I’ve been restructuring the book so that it really hones in on one strong idea. 5his has been much harder than I thought it would be 😩\n@PenguinBooks I’ve bounced from having a 3-part structure to a 4-part structure, back down to a 2-part structure…\n\nI’ve found that asking “what kind of structure would I prefer as a reader?” cuts through the brain fog.\n@PenguinBooks 3. Identifying my Target Audience\n\nidentifying who I’m writing for turned out to be a lot harder than I thought. \n\nI guess I sort of had an image of someone like my younger self in mind. but it turns out I can + probably should write for a broader audience.\n@PenguinBooks 4. Unique vs Relatable\n\nFinding the balance between this is tricky. I want to write a book that readers can relate to but I also want to be able to share my actual journey from med student to entrepreneur.\n@PenguinBooks sharing too much about my journey could make the message less relatable so there’s a balance to be had here.\n\nmost people work in a normal 9-5 job, instead of earning a living making videos on the internet lol.\n@PenguinBooks 5. Filling a Chapter with Ideas\n\nIt turns out that knowing what to write about is much harder than actually writing it.\n@PenguinBooks Hiring a freelance editor to help out has been GAME-CHANGING - Rachel (my editor) helps me hammer out what I want to say over a 1-hour Zoom call, then sets me writing assignments each week.\n@PenguinBooks the ‘what do I write about’ bit is figured out, and I can get on with bashing out chapters ✍️\n@PenguinBooks So what next?\n\nI’ve got a deadline of July 2022 for the complete draft of the manuscript.\n\nI’ve got a solid editing team at PenguinUKBooks and @MacmillanUSA to help shape it up, and a bunch of international publishers who’ll be translating the book as soon as it’s ready.\n@PenguinBooks @MacmillanUSA In theory, we'll launch simultaneously all around the world around mid-late-2023.\n\nIt's all coming together 👀\n@PenguinBooks @MacmillanUSA If you’d like to hear more about book-writing and what’s actually in my book, I’m planning a monthly newsletter with updates on my thought process, research, and all the highs + lows\n\nhttps://t.co/DMXFWro8gG",

A good way to deepen the conversation (once we’ve discovered the main problem), is to ask which one of the three P’s they’d like to discuss:\n1. Project - the technical content of their problem.\n2. Person- issues with colleagues, family, etc.\n3. Pattern of behaviour - are they getting in their own way?\n\nthis gives us a good framework to start any coaching/advice conversation\n🤔 2. The AWE Question: 'And what else?'\n\nAsking 'and what else?' stops us from diving in with advice after hearing someone’s problems.\n\nIt also gets all of the issues on the table as the first-level answer to 'what’s on your mind' may not address the biggest issue.\neg - ‘I feel like Jane doesn’t listen to me’ could turn into ‘and actually, I feel like no-one in the flat really listens to what I have to say’\n\nhaving even a little bit more context makes our advice-giving at least 20-30% better\n🔍 3. The Focus Question: What’s the real challenge here for you?\n\nEveryone loves fixing problems and ticking them off our to-do list.\n\nBut, we rarely stop to ask “are we solving the right problem?”\nwhen we ask \"what’s the real challenge here for you?\" we allow somebody time to slow down and think about what their real problem is, before they put loads of work into a possibly pointless solution.\nThis also saves us from discussing multiple problems, and going round in circles.\n\nPeople can spend days fine-tuning a Notion page or Task Manager template, before realising it doesn’t actually solve any of their real problems.\n🎯 4. The Foundation Question: What do you want?\n\nsometimes the person we’re talking to will know their problem inside out, and recognise the challenges… but still not know what they actually want to happen.\n1. Answer the question for them: “oh, I guess what I really want is X. I’ll go get that done”\n2. Get to the heart of their problem: “hm, I guess what I really want is to move to the US. Then all of my problems would be solved”\n3. Give them the confidence to finally make a request: “actually Ali, what I really want is for you to stop using me as a guinea pig for your weird coaching methods”\nWe've got to pay attention at this point: every answer has a subtext. It’s usually one of what Marshall Rosenberg calls The Nine Self-Explanatory Needs. https://t.co/I3t3gTssq2\n🦥 5. The Lazy Question: How can I help?\n\nIf we haven’t already got a clear request from asking what do you want, then \"how can I help?\" should do the trick.\n\nmore importantly, this question is super efficient\nyou can always guide people through their own problem-solving process, asking: “what have you tried so far?\" or \"what are your first thoughts about this?\"\n🎓 6. The Learning Question: What was most useful for you from this conversation?\n\nthis last question is partly so we can improve as advice-givers by getting feedback on what worked and what didn’t. but asking the Learning Question has a few other benefits:\n1. It frames the conversation as something positive, shifting both of us into growth mindset mode.\n\n2. It makes the person we’re talking to actively recall the whole conversation in their mind, which reinforces any lessons they learned.\n3. It makes things more personal and shows that we care about their feedback.\n\n4. It also sneakily reminds people that you’re a pretty helpful person 😇\n5. By asking this question we'll get 90% of the feedback value in half the time. And we’ll definitely get feedback, because (unlike “was this convo helpful”?) it’s not a yes/no question.",

        "thread": "So 2021 was a pretty wild ride.\n\nI quit medicine, moved city, hit 2M subscribers, got covid, and my team grew from 3 people to almost 20.\n\nHere are 12 things I learned along the way 👇\n1. Stay scrappy\nThis is a concept from ‘The Minimalist Entrepreneur’ by Sahil Lavingia (@shl).\n\nThe bigger my business gets, the easier it is to go into perfectionist mode and agonise over every little thing.\n\nI’m trying to recapture that scrappy mentality I had at the beginning.\n@shl 2. @SteveBartlettSC’s quitting framework\nQuitting isn’t for losers, it’s for winners. knowing when to quit something is a big life skill. Here’s how it works: https://t.co/SWt5w2kERW\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 3. The gap and the gain\n\nIf we want to motivate ourselves, we should look back at the gain we’ve made (’wow I’m looking way more hench compared to last year’), instead of judging ourselves by the gap between us and our ideal outcome (’😢 I still don’t look like Zac Efron’).\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 4. Optimise for the life you want to lead day-to-day\n\nregularly stop to ask yourself what you really want from life - maybe by journaling or doing weekly reviews.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC It’s easy to spend our life running on a never-ending treadmill (school → uni → good job → big savings account → safe retirement), without doing the things that actually bring us happiness or contentment.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 5. Delegation is hard but changes the game \n\nif someone else can do something better or quicker than you, and you can afford it, it’s a no-brainer to delegate\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 6. Embrace the suck \n\nWhenever I struggle with procrastination (eg writing my book), I lower the bar by telling myself that ‘I just need to write 500 crappy words for a crappy first draft of chapter 3’.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC repeating ‘crappy’ two times helps to neutralise my inner perfectionist. i always get more done that way, and I’m usually pleasantly surprised by the outcome.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 7. Separation of tasks \n\nThis is from a book called ‘The Courage to be Disliked’ by Ichiro Kishimi + Fumitake Koga. The basic idea is that it’s my task to have good intentions, control my own thoughts and actions in the right way.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC Whatever others do (cut me off on the road, be mean to me, judge me) is their thing to deal with\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 8. Be yourself when dating \n\nsure, we can change as people. but there’s a point at which self-improvement goes too far in dating, and it feels more like putting on an act\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC Generally, the more I act like my normal self on dates, the happier I am with the outcome.\n\nIf we don’t end up together, great: we didn’t really match. If we do end up together, also great: my partner likes me, not some fantasy version of myself.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 9. Keep your friends close, but your Kindle closer\n\nI lost my Kindle while moving house a few months ago, and my sleep quality went massively downhill.\n\nI was Insta-scrolling at 1am, when usually I’d be reading books using the warm-light setting.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 10. Learning languages through audiobooks is fun + easy \n\na while ago I got my Japanese to a reasonable standard in just 2 months by (fairly passively) listening to ‘Total Japanese with the Michel Thomas Method’ 20 minutes each night.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC 11. Sometimes magic = investing a ton of time\n\nThe amazing tech YouTuber @mrwhosetheboss was on my podcast recently, and I was pretty shocked by how he spends up to 50hrs of solid work for 20mins of video footage.\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC @Mrwhosetheboss it reminded me of something the magicians Penn and Teller say: sometimes magic is what happens if you put more time into something than any reasonable person would do\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC @Mrwhosetheboss 12. Question your assumptions\n\nIt dawned on me recently that I’ve been living with a bunch of incorrect assumptions for years and years.\n\nStuff like: ‘people won’t follow my channel if I stop being a doctor’ or ‘I need to put out 2 videos a week’\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC @Mrwhosetheboss Recently I’ve started examining these assumptions, and found out how wrong they are. \n\nThink of your assumptions like packets of food in the cupboard - have a rummage every now and then, and if you find anything that’s a bit funky or past its sell-by-date: chuck it out...\n@shl @SteveBartlettSC @Mrwhosetheboss BONUS LESSON: if you’re worried about your belly, stop ordering takeaway every day 😂\n\nwhat did you learn in 2021?",

        "thread": "Does having good production value matter on YouTube? \n\nYes and no, depending on how far along you are on the YouTube journey 👇\nYouTube is a ‘don’t run before you can walk’ platform. focus on learning the basics and how to be consistent before thinking about upgrading to loads of fancy equipment.\nProduction value can over-complicate things. \n\nat the beginner stage, make it simple. it’s as easy as flipping your iPhone camera + pressing record\nStart with the basics 👇\n\nLet’s say you’re trying to post once a week consistently. at this stage, the quality doesn’t need to be amazing, you just need to get content out there.\nThen move onto consistently producing content. the goal is to focus on making small improvements to your production value over time.\nFirst, try to focus on upping your audio quality.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be anything fancy, but nothing is more annoying on YouTube than bad audio. \n\nPeople will watch a video with poor visuals if the content is good, but they’ll turn off immediately if the audio is bad.\nConsistency is the aim of the game.\n\nYou can shoot with your phone + invest in a $15 mic and that will make all the difference.\n\nThen just post 1x video per week and make those 1% tweaks - in a few months you’ll be hitting milestones you thought were out of reach 🥳",

Set it as a priority for the day. \n\nSounds simple, but how many times have you sat down in the evening and thought “I didn’t get a single useful thing done today”?\nSetting a Daily Highlight helps us do stuff that actually matters. If we did our highlight every day for a year, that’d be 365 goals achieved - which sounds pretty good. \n\nHere are some tips for setting your Daily Highlight👇\ntry to start your Daily Highlight with a verb e.g. ‘write 5 pages of my book’ or ‘record 1 YouTube video today’ - that’s clear + prompts action.\nIf you’ve been procrastinating on a particular project, set your sights lower e.g. plan for a 10 minute, very low-effort run around the block instead of a 2-hour gym sesh.\n\nThis makes it way easier to get started. Activation energy is everything.\nTry to make your Daily Highlight something you could do in a single sitting.\n\nDon’t let something take up the whole day and leave you feeling drained, especially when you’re just getting started.\nchoosing Daily Highlights that are clear + easy will fuel your motivation-fire over time 🔥\n📅 2 - Stick it in the calendar\n\nonce I’ve set my Daily Highlight, I time-block it in my calendar, and protect that time from any meetings or distractions that pop up during the day.\nthis gives my future self the clearest possible directions and plenty of time to do what matters most: getting stuff done.\n\n“You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from.” - @NirEyal\n@nireyal 🤔 3 - Make a Might-Do List\n\nunlike a list of stuff I have to do, your “might-do” list is a brain dump of tasks you could do if you feel like it. this clears my brain of internal clutter and helps to confirm that my Daily Highlight is the highest-priority thing for the day\n@nireyal Even if you just spend 10 seconds setting your Daily Highlight in the morning, I guarantee you’ll be more productive + intentional with your time 😃\n@nireyal if you liked the Daily Highlight, here’s 9 other time management tips I use every day: [https://t.co/Pj7h0Ohd0S](https://t.co/Pj7h0Ohd0S)",

A thread 🧵\nThe truth is, not everyone wants the same thing when it comes to being a creator, and that’s okay. but, if you don’t know what you want, you’re never going to get there\n\nso, here are 3 ways you can work out what you want as a creator...\n⚖️ 1 - creatorpreneur spectrum\n\nEvery creator kinda fits one of these 3 categories:\n\na. Solopreneur - goal to do things alone (eg @jackbenedwards)\n\nb. Lifestyle biz - goal to grow, but keep it fun (eg me)\n\nc. Performance biz - goal to maximise growth (eg @MrBeast)\n\nwhich are you?\n@jackbenedwards @MrBeast 🔮 2 - the 3-year dream\n\nwhat does our dream creative side-hustle look like in 3 year? really think about this. Like, how much money are you making? how big is your audience? what content are you creating? would love to hear what your creator dreams are\n@jackbenedwards @MrBeast ❤️ 3 - intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation\n\nintrinsic motivation = doing stuff because you find it fun/rewarding. extrinsic motivation = doing stuff because you want a reward (eg X no. of subs)\n\nyour motivation can be either as long as you 1) put in the work + 2) enjoy the journey\n@jackbenedwards @MrBeast tbh there are a bunch of ways you can think about this stuff. I wasn’t too sure what the hell i was doing to begin with (+ still figuring stuff out now), but if you're looking for any amount of money/growth then it's worth thinking about asap in your creative journey\n@jackbenedwards @MrBeast If your goals are anything like mine (ie make quality content, grow my audience, and maybe make a bit of money), then you might be interested in signing up for the mailing list of my new Part-Time Creatorpreneur course 👇\n\nhttps://t.co/rQc9Dsgtpb",

It was interesting to you to read for the first time and most people are beginners and in that same boat.\n@Julian using a Novelty Index in our note-taking has 3 advantages:\n\n1 - we always have a curated list of exciting, novel topics to write about.\n@Julian 2 - we can avoid the curse of knowledge - assuming that what’s obvious to us is obvious to everyone else.\n@Julian The Novelty Index reminds us of just how mind-blowing an idea was to us as a beginner, and that it could still blow other people’s minds if we write about it + share it online...\n@Julian 3 - if we look back and see that everything we’ve read over the last month's scores between 1-3, we should probably challenge ourselves a bit more.\n\nso keeping a quick scorecard of what you’re consuming can improve your Information Diet\n@Julian I love coming across techniques like this. let me know if you try it out or if you have any others :)\nTagged wrong Julian Shapiro initially, sorry @Julian 😆",

        "thread": "I've been having many chats about love and relationships recently and as it turns out, there's a lot more to building a relationship than just loving someone 😬\n\nHere are 6 factors that can help or hinder healthy relationships 👇\n✈️ 1 - Long-distance vs short-distance\n\nAs with most of these points, it depends on what kind of person you are. Some of us can handle time spent apart. Distance makes the heart grow fonder and all that... and others prefer to go home to their partner at the end of a long day.\n💼 2 - What you do for work\n\nWhen you choose to be in a relationship, your work affects your partner and vice versa. Ask yourself, do you want someone with the same work ethics? In the same industry? At the same level? Or, something different to spice up your life?\n💭 3 - What we believe\n\nIf you want your relationship to be healthy, you probably want to align on belief systems early on. This doesn't mean you have to have the same religious, philosophical or ethical beliefs, but its good to get it all out on the table to avoid issues.\n❤️ 4 - Our core values\n\nOn the same note, our values affect the ways we behave and make decisions, and tell us how we expect others to react. Having different values from your partner can teach you to be more open-minded, or it can cause arguments and rifts.\n😷 5 - \"In sickness and in health\"\n\nHealth issues, whether mental or physical are tough to deal with, especially when they happen to the person you love. Open communication about what your partner needs, emotional availability and shared routines are all healthy and helpful.\n💸 6 - Money, Money, Money\n\nIn the words of @hannahwitton in our recent pod chat: \"love does not conquer your bank account\".\n\nFinancial issues are one of the leading causes of breakups and divorce and getting on the same page about money habits is a step in the right direction.\n@hannahwitton I recently talked about healthy relationships and everything in-between with sex educator, @hannahwitton you can watch the full podcast here 👇\nhttps://t.co/IqYeuFE3Tv",
