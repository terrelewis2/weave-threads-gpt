And it was embarrassing AF\n\nBut that little typo will end up bringing my business $400,000+ of extra recurring revenue \n\nThe story of the most profitable typo I’ve ever experienced:\nAfter weeks of hard work, the day finally arrived\n\nWe were finally launching a new productized agency called Dispatch, unlimited beautiful design services (decks, apps, websites etc) for cheap\n\nMe and the team were overwhelmed with excitement\n\nYou know that feeling…\nThe launch plan?\n\nSend an email to my 97,000 Substack subscribers\n\nEasy peasy...\n\nAll I have to do is come up with an interesting topic for the post and hit send\n\nSo, I think to myself what’s the juiciest topic I’ve never shared that might be mega interesting?\n\nOMG, I got it...\nI write about the time Twitter tried to buy my company Late Checkout for 8 figures and I rejected it\n\nPeople are going to want the juicy details so they’ll read to the end\n\nAnd that’s when I’ll slap them with the hey, you should check out Dispatch\n\n*and the crowd goes wild*\nI hit send on the newsletter and wait anxiously for the feedback to start rolling in\n\nBut as I read through the email again, my heart sank\n\nThere it was, plain as day - a typo in the link\n\nIt was hideous...\nInstead of https://t.co/VJ8rvoEDsB it was https://t.co/rgCGbDQl7z \n\nIm such an idiot\n\nBut I thought to myself:\n\n\"Maybe I'm overthinking it. No one will notice\"\n\nBut I couldn't have been more wrong...\nBecause that's when the emails from subscribers started pouring in...\n\nFrom well-known founders in Silicon Valley to a 15 year old high school student from Saint Louis, MO, they all noticed \n\nArghhhh\n\nMy inbox was BLOWING up https://t.co/3NyTqA7IUm\nAnd then the jokes start pouring in from my team. lmao\n\nI deserved it\n\nMy fav?\n\n\"I'll bet https://t.co/S4fAx7MNte is available\" \n\nNope, probably taken... \"by you greg...\"\n\nlolol https://t.co/353p5wjjW4\nI was embarrassed and plain anxious \n\nBut I was reminded of that old Seneca quote from Into the Quietude\n\n\"It is in the quietude of retreat that we are able to find ourselves again.\"\n\nI closed my laptop, went for a walk and channel my inner Seneca\n\nI needed \"quietude\" to function\nI come back to my laptop to notice we have $1.25M of qualified leads!!\n\nThe sales team is already setting up calls\n\nIf 1/3 convert, that's literally $400k+\n\nI don't get it... what happened?

but moved from 5h to 7h/night \n\nWhat's worked for me:\n\n- Stop drinking 3h before bed (won't wakeup to go to the bathroom)\n- No laptops in the bed (bedroom isn't a place for work)\n- Blackout blinds\n- Beam Dream Powder 30 mins before bed\nFor those asking what Beam Dream Powder is.. \n\nIt's a hot cocoa that is a mix of magnesium, CBD, reishi but puts you to sleep and helps you stay asleep\n\nI was super skeptical of it because melatonin didn't work for me, but can't live without it now\n\nI also love the ritual\nIt's 50% off today\n\nIf you use my promo code (gregisenberg), it's 20% off all following orders too\n\nhttps://t.co/UmkEEllilC\nMeltatonin never worked for me.

Not anymore\n\nTo name a few:\n\n- Fund via your community\n- Fund via NFTs/tokens\n- Fund via SBA loans\n- Fund via accelerators all over the world\n- Etc \n\nAll of a sudden, you have 10x the options\nMy head spins thinking about how much is changing in our world right now\n\nEx:\n\n- ↑ creators who need support \n- ↑ social commerce\n- ↑ sustainability products\n- ↑ internet usage across the globe\n- ↑ Desire for people to save/make $ during the downturn\n\nThis won’t last forever\nExample: we launched a free newsletter @yupdateco  for folks who want to stay updated on surviving this economic downturn\n\nWe could monetize via subscription, courses or paid ads\n\nRight now its free for the first 100,000 subcribers\n\nhttps://t.co/fZPhfSnIpx\nNiche businesses can be worth billions\n\nPeople used to laugh at niche\n\nWhy “go small” when you could “go big”?\n\nThe way to go big right now IS to go small\n\nLarge tech companies can’t be everything to everyone\nEverything is unbundling before our eyes\n\n- Facebook groups\n- eBay\n- Zoom\n- Etsy\n- Reddit\n- Udemy\n\nWhat a wonderful time to be building a startup\nYou can attract niches easier than ever\n\nStart with the community, then build software\n\n                           VERSUS\n\nStart with software, then build community\n\nPoint: you increase your odds of success by building community-first\nNo-code/low-code tools\n\nLaunching isn’t the hard part anymore\n\nThe hard part:\n\n- Building community\n- Creating an opinionated product\n- Co-building with the community\n- Finding wonderful teammates\n- Community/product fit\n\nThe tools are out there\nThe knowledge is out there \n\nBetween podcasts, Discord/Slack communities, YouTube and Twitter, the \"secrets\" to startup are at your disposal\n\nAnd it’s free…grab it\nThe playing field is leveling\n\nSF held the monopoly on startups for decades\n\nIf you wanted to be in tech, you had to be there\n\nNow, it barely matters if you're sitting in San Francisco or Santiago\nMore risk aversion because of the economic downturn\n\n↑ fear, ↓ makers, ↑ higher chance of success\nTikTok and Instagram Reels\n\nLove it or hate it, TikTok and Instagram Reels are giving entrepreneurs a window to be able to share their product with millions for free\n\nThe hard part is coming creating content and stories that spread on those platforms\n\nBut it's happening daily\nI know the sentiment right now is pretty negative about the economy etc, but hopefully this is a sign to take that leap\nFollow me @gregisenberg and

think right now is the greatest time to launch a startup\n\nYou should probably consider starting/joining something\n\nA few reasons why:\nYou can start with the community \n\nI’ve identified ~8000 communities that could be unbundled from Reddit to support a ~$1m/year revenue business \n\nBonus: you often need $400 max to build MVP to tap that untapped value\n\nSounds like a dream experiment to me\nYou can run a $100m/year business from your iPhone \n\nI have a friend who’s company makes $100m/yr\n\nFacts:\n- He started it in 2018\n- It’s niche\n- Unbundled from a FB Group \n- Moved from SF to Malta because he likes the vibe \n- He runs his entire biz from his iPhone on an island!\nYou have 10x the amount of funding sources\n\nYou used to have to rely on

anymore\n\nTo name a few:\n\n- Fund via your community\n- Fund via NFTs/tokens\n- Fund via SBA loans\n- Fund via accelerators all over the world\n- Etc \n\nAll of a sudden, you have 10x the options\nMy head spins thinking about how much is changing in our world right now\n\nEx:\n\n- ↑ creators who need support \n- ↑ social commerce\n- ↑ sustainability products\n- ↑ internet usage across the globe\n- ↑ Desire for people to save/make $ during the downturn\n\nThis won’t last forever\nExample: we launched a free newsletter @yupdateco  for folks who want to stay updated on surviving this economic downturn\n\nWe could monetize via subscription, courses or paid ads\n\nRight now its free for the first 100,000 subcribers\n\nhttps://t.co/fZPhfSnIpx\nNiche businesses can be worth billions\n\nPeople used to laugh at niche\n\nWhy “go small” when you could “go big”?\n\nThe way to go big right now IS to go small\n\nLarge tech companies can’t be everything to everyone\nEverything is unbundling before our eyes\n\n- Facebook groups\n- eBay\n- Zoom\n- Etsy\n- Reddit\n- Udemy\n\nWhat a wonderful time to be building a startup\nYou can attract niches easier than ever\n\nStart with

community-first\nNo-code/low-code tools\n\nLaunching isn’t the hard part anymore\n\nThe hard part:\n\n- Building community\n- Creating an opinionated product\n- Co-building with the community\n- Finding wonderful teammates\n- Community/product fit\n\nThe tools are out there\nThe knowledge is out there \n\nBetween podcasts, Discord/Slack communities, YouTube and Twitter, the \"secrets\" to startup are at your disposal\n\nAnd it’s free…grab it\nThe playing field is leveling\n\nSF held the monopoly on startups for decades\n\nIf you wanted to be in tech, you had to be there\n\nNow, it barely matters if you're sitting in San Francisco or Santiago\nMore risk aversion because of the economic downturn\n\n↑ fear, ↓ makers, ↑ higher chance of success\nTikTok and Instagram Reels\n\nLove it or hate it, TikTok and Instagram Reels are giving entrepreneurs a window to be able to share their product with millions for free\n\nThe hard part is coming creating content and stories that spread on those platforms\n\nBut it's happening daily\nI know the sentiment right now is pretty negative about the economy etc, but hopefully this is a sign to take that leap\nFollow me @gregisenberg and
