Take everything with a grain of salt.\n1. Creating wealth:\nIf creating wealth is one of your top goals, you are better off in India or even in places like Dubai. Most European countries have very high taxes. On average, salaries might be slightly higher than in India.\nBut if you are highly skilled, the wages in India are probably higher. If your sole reason for moving to Europe is to create wealth, don't do it. \n\nYou are better off building a career in India itself or finding a remote job in India.\n2. Expensive to get house help or any other manual work:\nIf you are one of those people who tend to get house help, home chef etc., you will have a hard time. Hourly wages are much higher. You'll need to do most things on your own.\n3. Missing friends and family\nIf you already have a good friend circle, you will miss them. The same is true for the family. I'm lucky to spend a long time with my family due to the nature of my work. But understand that it's an exception, not the rule.\nThe other side of this line of thought is that I'm probably spending more time with family than when I was living in India. But the feeling of proximity (or the lack of it) is a big deal.\nWith my move to the Netherlands, I've been lucky to meet many friends and build a community. It helps a lot. But some days, you miss home. That feeling never goes away.\n4. Feeling of belonging\nIt might be personal, but it's tough to feel the belonging. I've heard from US/UK-based colleagues that English speaking is a significant factor in this. Even if you learn the language, blending in is hard - you'll always be an outsider.\n5. Passive aggressiveness\nI've never experienced any form of direct racism - but passive-aggressiveness can be expected depending on the place. It exists in the form of uncomfortable stares, getting treated differently, and catcalls from random people.\nBut understand that racism is a problem with people - you have racists and casteists in India. Bad people are everywhere, but there are more kind people around.\n6. Weather\nIf you are one of those people who feels gloomy with an overcast sky, life can be challenging for you. Summer is short, and the sunshine is less compared to Indian weather. Of course, some places don't fall into this category - but most do.\n7. Beauracracy \nThis is the number one thing I hate about living in a foreign country.

Take everything with a grain of salt.\n1. Creating wealth:\nIf creating wealth is one of your top goals, you are better off in India or even in places like Dubai. Most European countries have very high taxes. On average, salaries might be slightly higher than in India.\nBut if you are highly skilled, the wages in India are probably higher. If your sole reason for moving to Europe is to create wealth, don't do it. \n\nYou are better off building a career in India itself or finding a remote job in India.\n2.","content_length":758,"content_tokens":170,"embedding":[]},{"twitter_handle":"soorajchandran_","essay_url":"https://twitter.com/soorajchandran_/status/1607948080946753537","essay_date":"2022-12-28T03:54:31+00:00","content":"Expensive to get house help or any other manual work:\nIf you are one of those people who tend to get house help, home chef etc., you will have a hard time. Hourly wages are much higher. You'll need to do most things on your own.\n3. Missing friends and family\nIf you already have a good friend circle, you will miss them. The same is true for the family. I'm lucky to spend a long time with my family due to the nature of my work. But understand that it's an exception, not the rule.\nThe other side of this line of thought is that I'm probably spending more time with family than when I was living in India. But the feeling of proximity (or the lack of it) is a big deal.\nWith my move to the Netherlands, I've been lucky to meet many friends and build a community. It helps a lot. But some days, you miss home.","content_length":809,"content_tokens":195,"embedding":[]},{"twitter_handle":"soorajchandran_","essay_url":"https://twitter.com/soorajchandran_/status/1607948080946753537","essay_date":"2022-12-28T03:54:31+00:00","content":"That feeling never goes away.\n4. Feeling of belonging\nIt might be personal, but it's tough to feel the belonging. I've heard from US/UK-based colleagues that English speaking is a significant factor in this. Even if you learn the language, blending in is hard - you'll always be an outsider.\n5. Passive aggressiveness\nI've never experienced any form of direct racism - but passive-aggressiveness can be expected depending on the place. It exists in the form of uncomfortable stares, getting treated differently, and catcalls from random people.\nBut understand that racism is a problem with people - you have racists and casteists in India. Bad people are everywhere, but there are more kind people around.\n6. Weather\nIf you are one of those people who feels gloomy with an overcast sky, life can be challenging for you. Summer is short, and the sunshine is less compared to Indian weather.","content_length":889,"content_tokens":193,"embedding":[]},{"twitter_handle":"soorajchandran_","essay_url":"https://twitter.com/soorajchandran_/status/1607948080946753537","essay_date":"2022-12-28T03:54:31+00:00","content":"Of course, some places don't fall into this category - but most do.\n7.

People are not driven by careers or jobs and have identities outside of work.\n2/ You can have a comfortable position and have sufficient time to pursue other significant aspects of your life. Life is not just about work; people are not running the rat race.\n3/Wealth creation: \nIf your top priority is to create more wealth, Europe might not be the best place to move. You can make way more in India with the exploding startup scene if you consider yourself a great talent. You also spend less and save more.\n4/If you consider yourself an average talent, you have better chances of creating wealth in Europe. The pay difference between good and great in Europe is minimal.\n5/Access to US jobs:\nYou also have the advantage of having more access to US jobs from Europe. US startups pay way more than average EU startups, and again if wealth creation is one of your priorities, it opens up a whole new world.\n6/Quality of life:\nTop-notch. From simple things like faster, stable internet, no power cuts, running hot water to better waste management, healthcare, and infrastructure, the quality of life is simply the best. This is even more meaningful if you are from a developing nation.\n7/Culture:\nIf you are tired of intolerance and nosy relatives, Europe is great. People respect personal space. You can be yourself. \nThis also comes with a downside - forming a deep relationship is more challenging than in an Indian setting.\n8/Freedom:\nThere is a lot of freedom, especially for women from a patriarchal society. Once you experience the taste of freedom, it is hard to go back to a more conservative community. You can live on your own terms.\n9/Travel:\nIf you love traveling, Europe is a great base. With a Schengen visa, you can travel to most of Europe. All cities are well connected by cheap flights and excellent trains.\n10/Community:\nYou will miss the 3 Fs. Food, Family, and Friends. I'm married to my best friend, so I miss my friends less. But if a few of my close friends were around, the quality of life would be much better.\n11/Family: I'm very close to my parents. I usually visit my family every 6 months and spend 2-3 months at home. But some days, you miss them more. \n\nThe international population in Europe is on the rise, but still significantly less compared to the UK and the US.\n12/Belonging:\nYou will always be an outsider. It is hard to feel at home. People are generally a bit cold compared to the US, making it harder to make friends.\n13/ When I started my first job, I had many amazing co-workers I made friends with. But that's that. I've met many people outside of work but never made friends.\n14/ Passive aggressiveness:\nI've never experienced any form of direct racism - but passive-aggressiveness can be expected depending on the place. It exists in the form of uncomfortable stares, getting treated differently, and catcalls from random people.\n15/ But understand that, racism is a problem with people - you have racists and casteists in India. Bad people are everywhere, but there are more kind people around.\n16/Bureaucracy: \nThis is the number one thing I hate about living in a foreign country. Much of your brainpower is lost dealing with paper works, and red tapes.\n17/ Countries like Germany are far from converting the old process online for a developed nation. India, for instance, is way ahead in getting things done online.\n18/ The million-dollar question: Will you settle in Europe?
